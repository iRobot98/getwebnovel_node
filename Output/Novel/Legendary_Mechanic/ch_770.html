				<h3>Chapter 770 Independence</h3>
<p>A large fleet appeared not too far away from Floating Dragon Island with Han Xiao’s spaceship being at the very front.</p>
<p>Aurora was seated in the pilot’s seat with Han Xiao standing behind her with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>Floating Dragon now had three different islands and a second field team in charge of guarding Floating Dragon. Looking out at the scenery, Han Xiao could not help but lament to himself.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>“I haven’t been back for quite some time, and the changes are truly great. So many years have gone by in just a blink of an eye. I still remember the first time I came to Floating Dragon…”</p>
<p>Du! Du!</p>
<p>Vilna’s face appeared on his communicator, and she said, “Your Excellency Black Star, Her Excellency Dragon Emperor is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>It seems like she knew that I would come and meet her… Han Xiao nodded.</p>
<p>The second field team opened a path and allowed the Black Star Army fleet to land on Floating Dragon Island.</p>
<p>“Black Star Guards follow me. The others remain here and await my orders,” Han Xiao instructed and led Hila and the others onto Floating Dragon.</p>
<p>On the dock, Jenny and the other officers were already waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Black Star.”</p>
<p>The various officers saluted him.</p>
<p>Although they had once been colleagues with Han Xiao, Han Xiao was now a Beyond Grade A Super, and his status in the galaxy far exceeded theirs. He was a figure who stood at the same level as the Dragon Emperor, and they could only look up to him.</p>
<p>Even Jenny, who had a terrible relationship with Han Xiao, also had her head lowered with a respectful appearance.</p>
<p>Aesop stepped out from the crowd and said with a complicated expression, “I knew that you would return. This day had to come eventually.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao then looked around at the faces of his colleagues before looking back at Aesop. Shaking his head, he said, “Didn’t you already start making preparations?”</p>
<p>“I just didn’t think that it would be so sudden…” Aesop let out a sigh before turning around to lead the way. “Follow me. Ames is already waiting for you.”</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>Han Xiao followed behind Aesop and entered the palace, only to see Ames seated on top of a floating throne with a calm expression on her face.</p>
<p>“You’re here. Black Star, I have been waiting for you,” Ames said as though she had already expected his arrival.</p>
<p>Han Xiao stood a few meters away, and Aesop’s group walked behind Ames. At this moment, there seemed to be an invisible barrier separating the two groups.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke immediately; they looked at each other silently instead. The Black Star and Floating Dragon officers who were by the side all could not help but gulp as their hearts tensed up.</p>
<p>The officers of both sides were aware of Han Xiao’s intentions and could not help but feel nervous upon seeing the tense atmosphere. They were afraid that the two Beyond Grade A Supers would start fighting because of some disagreement.</p>
<p>The new member of the Black Star Guards, Hadavy, was probably the only exception. He was currently sizing Ames up carefully, looking as though he was eager to test her strength.</p>
<p>After a silent standoff of over a minute, Ames shifted her gaze toward Aurora and Hila, who were beside Han Xiao, and asked, “How have both of you been over the past few months?”</p>
<p>Aurora did not dare face Ames’ gaze at this moment and lowered her head with guilt.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Hila replied.</p>
<p>Ames showed care and concern for her two disciples but ignored Han Xiao completely. Han Xiao was not too bothered by this and watched silently by the side.</p>
<p>The teacher and disciples chatted for a while before Ames changed the topic. “Are you two going to stand on his side?”</p>
<p>Hila and Aurora’s expressions changed slightly, and everyone felt their hearts tightened up slightly.</p>
<p>Before waiting for them to reply, Han Xiao waved to his Black Star Guards and said, “Hila, leave with them. Let me talk to Ames alone.”</p>
<p>Hila heaved a sigh of relief. She was not afraid of facing powerful enemies, but she did not wish to be sandwiched between her teacher of ten years and Han Xiao.</p>
<p>Ames tacitly approved of the departure of the Black Star Guards, and upon seeing this, Aesop had no choice but to take the officers of Floating Dragon away as well.</p>
<p>Aesop felt that it was extremely normal for Black Star to seek independence. If he was Ames, he would not stop Black Star but provide his support instead. However, Ames was not like him and tended to act in a willful manner. Furthermore, Black Star was the subordinate who she placed the greatest importance on, and Aesop was worried that Ames’ willfulness would ruin matters.</p>
<p>Only Han Xiao and Ames were left behind in the main hall. Ames controlled her floating throne to land, and she walked forward to face Han Xiao with a complicated look in her eyes.</p>
<p>“When I first saw you, I never imagined that you will be standing at the same height as me one day.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, the scene of how he met Ames floated up in Han Xiao’s mind.</p>
<p>Ames had been high above at that time, capable of controlling his life and death with a single thought. In comparison, he had been a small grain of sand in her eyes. Ten or so years later, he was now able to stand face to face with her as equals.</p>
<p>“Anything is possible in this world,” Han Xiao replied.</p>
<p>Ames smiled and said, “I know this feeling. A long time ago, I never imagined that I would become a Beyond Grade A Super either.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao stroked his chin and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment, Ames then asked, “Why are you here today?”</p>
<p>“There are three things.”</p>
<p>“Three things?” Ames raised her brows. “What’s the first?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao took out the Evolution Cube and said, “This treasure is in my hands. I am prepared to allow you and all the officers of Floating Dragon to enjoy the Evolution Cube.”</p>
<p>Ames was a little surprised but did not reply immediately. She asked instead, “What’s the second matter.”</p>
<p>“I request to leave Floating Dragon and allow the Black Star Army to gain independence,” Han Xiao said without the slightest bit of awkwardness.</p>
<p>“Humph, this is probably your true motive, right?”</p>
<p>Ames let out a soft sigh but wasn’t angry. She was already mentally prepared for this day to arrive but still felt a tinge of discomfort when Han Xiao said it. She then said expressionlessly, “I have something to ask you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Were you planning to leave me from the first day you joined Floating Dragon?”</p>
<p>Ames’ gaze was locked firmly on Han Xiao. Ever since she viewed the Black Star Army headquarters a few years ago, she had known that she was not suitable to be Han Xiao’s leader. She just wanted to be certain of Han Xiao’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Xiao replied honestly. From the very beginning, he had treated Floating Dragon as a jumping board. Even if saying so would make Ames angry, he did not intend to lie.</p>
<p>“I thought so.” Ames shook her head, and a tinge of sadness could be seen in her eyes. “I am not a leader worth following for someone like you.”</p>
<p>She had not felt this during the initial development of the Black Star Army, but as the prestige of the Black Star Army overshadowed Floating Dragon, she had understood that a legendary character like Han Xiao was not someone she could keep.</p>
<p>Ames did not hesitate in the slightest and did not bother trying to keep Han Xiao. She was not that weak and said with a resolute voice, “Alright. I understand. From today onward, Floating Dragon is Floating Dragon and the Black Star Army is the Black Star Army. You are no longer my subordinate.”</p>
<p>A notification immediately popped up on his interface indicating that he left the Floating Dragon faction.</p>
<p>Han Xiao let out a deep breath.</p>
<p>From this moment on, the Black Star Army was no longer a subordinate of Floating Dragon and was now an independent organization.</p>
<p>“What is the third matter?” Ames asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“I hope that the Black Star Army can form an alliance with Floating Dragon,” Han Xiao said. “I hope that you will fight alongside me against Heber and Psyker.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Ames’ face immediately became a little strange. She had already heard about the Beyond Grade A battle that shook the Shattered Star Ring. She was puzzled about Han Xiao’s actions.</p>
<p>“Since you want my help, why did you choose independence? You know that I would definitely help you if you chose to remain in Floating Dragon.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled and said with a carefree tone, “I know. That’s why I gave you a chance to choose.”</p>
<p>Ames was stunned for a moment and immediately understood what Han Xiao meant.</p>
<p>The way she saw it, as long as Han Xiao chose to remain in Floating Dragon, he could tie Floating Dragon to him and ensure that she would help him to deal with his enemies for sure. However, Han Xiao did not choose to make use of his identity as a Floating Dragon officer but chose to request help after leaving Floating Dragon.</p>
<p>This meant that Han Xiao did not want to make use of her. If not, he could choose to borrow Floating Dragon’s strength to deal with Heber and Psyker before gaining independence. It would be akin to making full use of her before leaving.</p>
<p>In truth, Ames had also considered such a possibility before their meeting. Even Ames herself did not know if she would have rejected Han Xiao if he had chosen such a route. The development of the situation was truly out of her expectations.</p>
<p>“Are you not afraid that I will reject you?” Ames suppressed the surprise in her heart and spoke calmly. “Your life will be in danger if you want to fight both of them alone. Aren’t you afraid that you won’t be able to pass this tribulation?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled and said, “I believe that you won’t reject me.”</p>
<p>Ames’ face then darkened, and she said coldly, “You are no longer my subordinate, and I haven’t accepted your alliance. Do you really think that I care a lot about you, or do you think that you have some chips in your hands that I won’t be able to reject? Do you want to make use of the Evolution Cube to persuade me? And go back on your word if I don’t agree?”</p>
<p>“My promise is valid regardless of whether you form an alliance with me.” Han Xiao shook his head. “That was something I brought up before leaving Floating Dragon. I am providing that benefit to you as an officer of Floating Dragon and do not plan to make use of it as a bargaining chip. You can treat it as my compensation to thank Floating Dragon for taking care of me.”</p>
<p>Ames had a strange look in her eyes, and she sized Han Xiao up as though she did not recognize him. “You are not someone like that in my mind.”</p>
<p>The way she saw it, the sequence of Han Xiao’s requests was completely wrong. He chose to leave Floating Dragon before seeking help and did not wish to use the Evolution Cube as a bargaining chip for their alliance but compensation toward Floating Dragon.</p>
<p>This was akin to surrendering his advantage and leaving the decision in her hands.</p>
<p>“Why?” Ames asked. Han Xiao’s current actions had overturned her impression of him.</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled. “I just feel that there isn’t a need for there to have so much scheming between us.”</p>
<p>Ames’ expression froze in place, and her breathing seemed to have stopped for a second.</p>
<p>She then looked at Han Xiao deeply and took two steps back. “I don’t know if the words you have said are true or false, but I can at least see some sincerity.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao’s lips curled up slightly, and he said, “It seems like we have come to an agreement.”</p>
<p>“I agree to your alliance.” Ames’ eyes shone before she slowly said, “Besides, I have long wanted to have a fight with Heber. Although you are a new Beyond Grade A Super, you definitely won’t drag me down with your strength.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, you are still the Ames that I know!” Han Xiao raised out his hand to shake Ames’ hand. “Alliance mate, please take care of me in the future.”</p>
<p>Ames looked at Han Xiao’s hand, which was floating in midair, and snorted.</p>
<p>“Humph, you used to call me Your Excellency Dragon Emperor but call me alliance mate now.”</p>
<p>After saying that, she raised out her hand as well.</p>
<p>Both of them shook hands.</p>
<p>Their alliance was set up from this moment on.</p>
<p>After shaking hands, they let go, and Han Xiao had a strange look on his face.</p>
<p>When they were shaking hands, Ames had squeezed hard as though she was throwing a tantrum. However, Han Xiao’s physical defense was too high, and he did not feel much.</p>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head and looked at the door of the palace. “Still eavesdropping? All of you, come in.”</p>
<p>Hila, Aesop, and the others walked out from behind the door with embarrassed looks on their faces.</p>
<p>They had all worried that Ames and Han Xiao would fall out with each other and did not go too far away. They had all been eavesdropping outside the door and were a little embarrassed since they had been caught. In actual fact, all of their actions could not possibly escape from the senses of a Beyond Grade A. It was just that Han Xiao and Ames could not be bothered with them.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the both of them resolving matters harmoniously, the atmosphere in the place became relaxed, and everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Although the Black Star Army had left Floating Dragon, both parties had formed an alliance, and they were still allies. The barrier between both parties disappeared immediately, especially since the officers of both parties had a good relationship in the first place.</p>
<p>Aesop was extremely relieved that Ames did not lose control of her emotions, and the outcome was much better than what he had expected. For two Beyond Grade A organizations to form an alliance, they would be able to gain a huge advantage in the Shattered Star Ring, and it was extremely beneficial to both parties.</p>
<p>My prediction back then wasn’t wrong. Ames will develop better with Black Star beside her, Aesop thought to himself. Back then, he had felt that Black Star would become the Dragon Emperor’s right-hand man to support her to the next level. Although his guess was not wrong, he had gotten a small detail wrong. Black Star would not be the Dragon Emperor’s right-hand man but an equal to the Dragon Emperor.</p>
<p>“Alright, since you are willing to work together with me, we have to decide how we should deal with Heber and Psyker,” Han Xiao said.</p>
<p>“What are you prepared to do?” Ames said with excitement.</p>
<p>“It has been some time since they issued a challenge to me, but I have yet to give them a reply. It is time for me to give them a reply. Since they want to create trouble, we should muddy the waters further. I will issue a joint response with you and shake the Shattered Star Ring even more.” Han Xiao’s eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>He could also make use of this opportunity to announce the independence of the Black Star Army and their alliance with Floating Dragon.</p>
<p>Han Xiao was sure that this would increase his influence to the next level!</p>
<p>“I thought that you’d ask me to keep this matter a secret and give them a good surprise,” Ames replied.</p>
<p>“We won’t be able to hide it from them, and there isn’t a need to do so. Since they challenged us openly, we can also reply to them openly,” Han Xiao said. “Since they want to be high profile, we shall accompany them in being high profile!”</p>
<p>Ames revealed a look of interest. “It sounds very fun.”</p>
<p>As Hadavy and the others heard that, they immediately grew excited and were agitated to the point they had goosebumps. The Shattered Star Ring had five Beyond Grade A Supers, and four of them were involved in this battle. Only the Magus was left out, and he would probably run over to join the fun. If that was the case, this battle would involve all the Beyond Grade A Supers in the Shattered Star Ring!</p>
<p>This was a one in a hundred years event, and it would definitely go down in the annals of history.</p>
<p>Just thinking of the sight of the five Beyond Grade A appearing together made Hadavy’s blood boil.</p>
<p>At this moment, Han Xiao suddenly said, “Before that, I have to fulfil my promise.”</p>
<p>After saying that, he took out the Evolution Cube and looked at Ames.</p>
<p>“Do I need to make any preparations?” Ames asked.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Ames nodded.</p>
<p>Although she did not chase after strength, she was extremely curious about the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>Opening the Evolution Cube, a wave of black particles surrounded Ames, and the gene evolution started.</p>
<p>Han Xiao looked at the other officers of Floating Dragon, and after seeing them nod, he controlled another new wave of black colored energy to evolve their genes.</p>
<p>Only Aesop waved his hands.</p>
<p>“Old man, don’t you want to use the Evolution Cube?” Han Xiao asked with doubt.</p>
<p>“Don’t need to worry about me.” Aesop waved his hands. “I used it a few hundred years ago when this item was still in the ruins. If not for the fact that it was too large and I was too lazy to find someone to shift it away, it would have been mine.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao truly did not know what to say.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The gene evolution continued for quite some time, and all the officers of Floating Dragon completed their evolution. Their strength experienced varying degrees of improvements, and they all had looks of joy on their faces. Only Ames was still being surrounded by the black particles.</p>
<p>After a few hours, Ames broke out of the ‘cocoon’ and experienced a huge change.</p>
<p>All the others had gone down to rest, and Han Xiao was the only one left in the hall. He was currently seated on Ames’ throne and scrolling through the forums for entertainment. Upon seeing Ames exit, he walked forward to Ames with a look of curiosity.</p>
<p>“How do you feel?”</p>
<p>Ames did not reply, and her brows were furrowed as though she was trying to feel something. Her figure then disappeared suddenly.</p>
<p>Han Xiao was stunned for a moment and extended his senses to feel the undulations of space around him.</p>
<p>At his current level, apart from his five basic senses, he could detect other things such as radiation, energy waves, and so on.</p>
<p>After extending his senses, Han Xiao was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>He could see Ames making circles around him in the Void Dimension.</p>
<p>“You are able to enter the Void Dimension?” Han Xiao asked with shock and entered the Void Dimension as well.</p>
<p>“It seems like this is my new ability,” Ames said excitedly.</p>
<p>Floating Dragon Island was built on top of the skeleton of a Void Dragon, and Ames had consumed the Void Dragon Pith before. Thus, she had a trace of Void Genes in her, which was activated by the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>Although they were not from the same Beyond Grade A race, they both had Void Genes, and a portion of their genes were similar.</p>
<p>After playing for a while, Ames left the Void Dimension and began testing her new strength.</p>
<p>“The effect of the Evolution Cube is truly amazing. The strength, range, and control of my Force Field have been increased, and my physique seems to have improved.”</p>
<p>That is because your attributes have increased…</p>
<p>Han Xiao had some experience with this. Ames did not have an interface and could not see the changes in her body.</p>

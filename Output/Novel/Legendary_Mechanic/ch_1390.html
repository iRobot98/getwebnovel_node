				<h3>Chapter 1390 Legacy Blueprints and the Showdown</h3>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head and temporarily threw this thought out.</p>
<p>The location of the World Tree was still unknown, so it was best not to think too much.</p>
<p>He turned to look at the (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy) on his Talent interface. This ability would unlock new exclusive blueprints when he was level 360. Although he had a rich technological foundation, no Mechanic would complain about having too many golden blueprints.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>Back when the (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy] was at Lv 320, it unlocked the King and the Emperor’s Cape. The former was still very useful.</p>
<p>This time, he unlocked three golden blueprints at level 360. Han Xiao opened the blueprint introduction and looked at it.</p>
<p>(Blueprint – Dark Energy Gold Furnace Beast): After the Saint Tyracles Race witnessed the greatness of the Mechanical Deity, they developed a series of special equipment specially designed for the Mechanical Deity. (Blueprint-Emperor Skysplitter Blade]: After the Saint Tyracles Race witnessed the greatness of the Mechanical Deity, they developed a series of special equipment specially designed for the Mechanical Deity.</p>
<p>(Blueprint-Space Constants Modifier (Incomplete)]: The Ultimate Technology of the Saint Tyracles Race has yet to be completed.</p>
<p>“This…”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Han Xiao’s mouth twitched.</p>
<div class="mjjdt60c810e97ed7d"></div>
<p>Of the five gold blueprints brought by (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy), three of them were equipment specially made for the Mechanical Deity. He finally saw how passionate this race was toward the Mechanical Deity. The Dark Gold Furnace Beast was an external special body. Its introduction was that it could share the power of the descent of the Mechanical Deity and had its own consciousness, serving as the mount of the Mechanical Deity. As for Emperor Skysplitter Blade, it was a large high-tech compound weapon. Its appearance was similar to a double-headed broadsword, and its blade was straight and wide. It had a lot of empty slots and could integrate different parts.</p>
<p>Han Xiao summoned the 3D model and briefly outlined the appearance of a Mechanical Deity. He then loaded the Emperor’s Robe, Dark Gold Furnace Beast, and Emperor Skysplitter Blade. Although the image was majestic, he felt that it was becoming more and more familiar.</p>
<p>“It looks more and more like Lord Guan Yu? It’s just that the weapon doesn’t match… Wait, why does it look a little like Thanos?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao mumbled softly, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>These Saint Tyracles scientists, who were fanatical about the Mechanical Deity, spent all their time researching and changing equipment. Did they think they were making mecha skins ?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the names of these blueprints, these scientists from the Saint Tyracles Race more or less had eighth-grader syndrome…</p>
<p>Han Xiao had the technology foundation of Jayz’s treasure and the Sanctum, so he did not lack gold blueprints for the Mechanical Deity. While these two blueprints were quite powerful, they did not provide much help. However, he realized that the Emperor’s Cape, the Dark Gold Furnace Beast, and the Emperor Skysplitter Blade actually had set effects, which was rare.</p>
<div></div>
<p>When all three items were activated at the same time, they could trigger a special set effect called ‘Tyracles’ Frenzy’. With the enhancement of 1.1x in total Machinery Affinity, attack, defense, and physical performance, it was not bad.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>What made Han Xiao excited was the last blueprint. The Saint Tyracles Race had a very deep understanding of space. This Space Constants Modifier, as its name suggested, could adjust the spatial structure of a region and change the universe constants.</p>
<p>The principle of this device involved the microscopic expansion of the universe and the collapse of the universe, as well as the technology of raising and lowering dimensions. According to the theory, it should have special effects such as extending or shrinking space, overlapping areas, intercepting or grafting spaces, and the changes to the area would be permanent. There was no time limit, and it was a strategic-level mechanical device.</p>
<p>For example, if the enemy was only three days away from him, this device could expand or shrink the strategic depth of the distance between the two sides. According to the limit of its effect, it could expand the three-day journey to more than ten days or even a few months, or it could even shorten the distance between them to an inch.</p>
<p>However, it was a pity that these were all theoretical conjectures. Before the Saint Tyracles Race could perfect this device, they were already destroyed by their enemies in the exploration era. If they could perfect this technology, the three Universal Civilizations might become the four Universal Civilizations or even the only civilization. However, there were no ifs in this world.</p>
<p>“Most of the technology left behind by the Saint Tyracles Race has been inherited by the Federation of Light. I wonder if they have this incomplete blueprint…”</p>
<p>Han Xiao stroked his chin and pondered.</p>
<p>The Space Constants Modifier was much more powerful than the World Tree’s Lerbo Space Protection Belt. If the Federation of Light had this technology, they would have used it back then. However, he could not rule out the possibility that it was incomplete.</p>
<p>After pondering for a while, Han Xiao shook his head and stopped thinking about it.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Regardless of whether the Federation of Light had it or not, he had it. If not for the talent (Tyracles Mechanical Legacy), he would not have had the chance to obtain it.</p>
<p>Beep beep beep… Just as Han Xiao was studying his new ability, his communicator suddenly rang. He received a message from the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>“Heh, it’s finally here.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao glanced at it and was not surprised.</p>
<p>The three Universal Civilizations would not be able to sit still after he opened up a new level of individual strength. They would come to talk to him sooner or later, but they did not come to him immediately after he advanced. They probably heard from Wuornos that he wanted to familiarize himself with his strength, so they did not dare disturb him.</p>
<p>After replying to a message, Han Xiao turned on his remote projection. His vision changed, and he was already in the conference room of the three Universal Civilizations’ leaders. He saw three people sitting side by side.</p>
<p>The three of them sized Han Xiao up carefully. Their faces were expressionless, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p>
<p>“Ahem, Black Star, I heard that you have broken through the upper limit of the Beyond Grade A realm and entered a new level of power. Congratulations, you have pioneered a new path.”</p>
<p>Marbruce forced a smile and nodded.</p>
<p>“It was just luck,” Han Xiao said humbly.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Is that so…”</p>
<p>Marbruce froze.</p>
<p>You seem to be the least qualified to say that…</p>
<p>At this moment, Han Xiao suddenly smiled at the Pope and said, “By the way, I haven’t thanked you for your help. It’s all thanks to you guys agreeing to lend me the Church’s National Treasure. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to advance.”</p>
<p>IIII</p>
<p>The corners of the Pope’s eyes twitched.</p>
<p>Provocation, this was definitely provocation!</p>
<p>The moment he thought of this, he regretted</p>
<div></div>
<p>it.</p>
<p>In his eyes, Han Xiao was mocking him for making a loss deal!</p>
<p>The Pope looked at Han Xiao’s smile and felt extremely disgusted. He wished he could pick up the cup on the table and smash it on Han Xiao’s head.</p>
<p>At this moment, Marbruce and Louis turned to look at him with a strange look in their eyes. They seemed to be blaming him for betraying their plan.</p>
<p>However, the two of them did not expect to see the Pope furious. The Pope took a deep breath to calm down, revealed an unfathomable smile, and said righteously,</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. You’ve entered a higher level, which is beneficial to the battle. Of course, we won’t be stingy.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao raised his brows. It seemed that Wuornos had indeed reported this to the upper echelons of the church, and he was probably eager to copy his method to advance. The Pope’s behavior this time was obviously because he thought Wuornos would be able to step into the Transcendent Grade very soon, so he felt that it was not a loss and had some confidence.</p>
<p>“Tsk, don’t blame me then. You were the one who couldn’t help it…’</p>
<p>Han Xiao curled his lips.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, when he invited Wuornos to help him advance, he really did not intend to trick him. At the very least, the Arcane Church’s National Treasure and the five elements combined were all real advancement conditions.</p>
<p>However, Han Xiao did not plan to tell anyone about the secret of the Beyonder’s Vestige. If Wuornos was determined to advance, he could only sit back and watch.</p>
<p>After all, Wuornos did not seem to want to participate in the battle. It did not matter to him whether he was dead or alive. In any case, even if he was dead, he could still display his use as Beyonder’s Vestige. Han Xiao did not mind at all…</p>
<p>However, after fulfilling two Promotion conditions, the success rate of the Promotion would increase by at least two-thirds. As long as Wuornos’ luck was not as bad as his, the Promotion would not be a problem… However, without the Beyonder’s Vestige, he could only trigger the regular Promotion. When he completed the Promotion excitedly, he would realize that he had not broken through the limit of the grade. Han Xiao wondered what expression he would have.</p>
<p>Han Xiao calmed himself down and casually asked, “You guys contacted me to congratulate?”</p>
<p>“This is a historical event, after all. We would like to ask if you want to make it public to the galactic society.”</p>
<p>Louis nodded and asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to publicize it. We’re still fighting. We don’t know if the World Tree will steal the intelligence on the Internet in the future. It’s enough for the upper echelons to know.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
<p>Seeing that the three of them had no objections, he suddenly turned to Marbruce and said,</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, I still need the dynasty’s help.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I plan to send EsGod into the Underworld after some time and make use of him on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>“This…”</p>
<p>Marbruce hesitated.</p>
<p>The dynasty had sealed EsGod for so long mainly because they wanted to study EsGod’s body after his soul was destroyed. Marbruce did not want to agree to this request, and he was also not willing to see the Underworld gain more experts. Seeing his hesitation, Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>“In exchange, I can provide you with a very interesting piece of information.”</p>
<p>“What information?”</p>
<p>“Gaud’s whereabouts.” Han Xiao smiled.</p>
<p>Marbruce’s pupils constricted.</p>
<p>Although he had guessed that it was Black Star who had caused Gaud’s disappearance, he could not help but feel furious upon hearing him admit it.</p>
<p>Thinking about how they had been fooled by Black Star back then and caused a huge storm, Marbruce’s face sank. He endured his anger and shouted,</p>
<p>“…So it was you!”</p>
<p>Han Xiao did not mind. He waved his hand and said, “Don’t be angry. I have a reason for doing this. If you are willing to agree to this deal, I will tell you the reason and give you Gaud’s whereabouts.”</p>
<p>Marbruce clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Black Star only revealed his cards now, which was undoubtedly related to the recent advancement. There was only one reason for him to do so, and that was that the strength of a Transcendent was beyond imagination. He no longer had to worry about the revenge of the advanced civilizations, which was why Black Star could reveal this secret without a care!</p>
<p>The strength of a Transcendent was still a mystery. They only knew that it was higher than a Beyond Grade A but other than Black Star, no one knew how strong it was. The unknown was the most terrifying.</p>
<p>With Black Star’s current confidence, it was clear that the strength of a Transcendent was no small matter. In fact, he had even chosen to show his cards at this time to show his might!</p>
<p>Thinking up to this point, Marbruce suddenly felt a strong sense of fear. The current situation did not allow for internal conflict. He had no choice but to suppress the anger in his heart and think about Black Star’s suggestion.</p>
<p>After a while, he nodded expressionlessly and said coldly,</p>
<p>“EsGod can be given to you, but we have to exchange for Gaud. I only hope that your reason will satisfy us.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, you’ll definitely be satisfied.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao did not mind it.</p>
<p>He had chosen this moment to show his cards because he wanted to strike while the iron was hot. His strength had advanced, if he did not show anything and continued to maintain their original relationship, the three Universal Civilizations might feel that he did not have much confidence. It was time to take a step forward, to pressure them and squeeze more benefits out of them. At the same time, he would let the three Universal Civilizations see his ‘unbridled’ attitude, which would make them even more afraid of his strength after advancing</p>
<p>Of course, the reason he did this was that the three Universal Civilizations could not do without the help of the association and because he did not need to fear the three Universal Civilizations anymore.</p>
<p>Some of the ‘crimes’ left behind in history could be brought up to the public since the three Universal Civilizations could no longer flip the table.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was not a good idea to keep Gaud locked up. The matter had to be resolved eventually. He had to tell the dynasty what had happened. In the future, if Evans obtained the Energy Control Esper Ability, he could use it openly. After glancing at the three of them, Han Xiao did not say anything. He deactivated the remote projection and disappeared from the room.</p>
<p>Only then did the three of them relax. They looked at each other with subtle expressions.</p>
<p>In this meeting, they mainly wanted to see if Black Star’s attitude had changed after his Promotion.</p>
<p>Back when the Beyond Grade As first appeared, they also had a huge impact on the structure of the universe. Although they did not know how large the gap in strength with the new level was this time, it would definitely not be too weak. Black Star was already recognized as the leader of the Beyond Grade As, and now that he had taken a step forward, the three of them had no choice but to reconsider how they should treat Black Star.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, the three of them had already come to a consensus to react according to the situation. If Black Star’s attitude did not change, they would treat him the same way they treated him in the past and treat him the same way in the future. They would pretend that the Promotion did not happen and not make any additional gestures.</p>
<p>However, Black Star’s attitude made their plans fall through. Seeing how fearless he was, the three of them felt their hearts sink. They knew that the scales of cooperation between the two sides were going to tip toward the association again.</p>
<p>However, they could not do without Black Star. The three of them did not dare to do anything anymore and were completely helpless.</p>
<p>Two days later, the Beyond Grade A Association.</p>
<p>There were no empty seats in the venue. All the association members had been summoned to attend this temporary meeting.</p>
<div class="mspxw60c810e97ed4f"></div>
<p>Everyone looked at Han Xiao with shock, excitement, and disbelief.</p>
<p>In the past few days, a rumor had spread among the upper echelons of the association, claiming that Black Star had broken through the Beyond Grade A realm and opened a new level.</p>
<p>At first, not many people believed it, but as more and more association members learned about it, many of them became skeptical.</p>
<p>Han Xiao looked at everyone’s expression and smiled.</p>
<p>“I gathered all of you today to announce something. From the looks of it, you should have heard about it in the past few days.”</p>
<div class="xxeke60c810e97eda7"></div>
<p>Hearing this, many people’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Black Star, is that rumor true?” Manison frowned in disbelief.</p>
<p>Han Xiao looked at him, then at the others who were staring at him, nodded, and said with a sonorous tone,</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ve already stepped into the realm above Beyond Grade A, and I’ve named it Transcendent Grade. From now on, Beyond Grade A is no longer the limit of individual strength… Everyone, there’s still a path ahead!”</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked! Everyone stared at Han Xiao in shock, unable to speak. The room fell into a strange silence.</p>

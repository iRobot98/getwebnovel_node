				<h1 class="chapter-title">1066 Concession from the dynasty, the Universe Celebrates</h1>
<div id="chapter-entity" class="chapter-entity">Ka la ka la…</p>
<p>The sound of machinery being assembled reverberated in the private workshop, and the flashing Mechanical Force was like flexible blue tentacles, manipulating the robotic arms to create a totally new King mechanical suit.</p>
<p>Han Xiao was fully absorbed, watching the details of the mechanical suit in his hands step by step.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>When the last piece of outer armor plate was attached to the chest area of the King, his interface pinged as a notification appeared.</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>You have built a Gold Grade equipment (Universal Treasure).</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>&#8220;Huu…&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao&#8217;s tense expression finally eased up, and he slowly exhaled.</p>
<p>This was the second Gold-grade mechanical suit of the King. With his successful experience from the last time as well as the bonuses granted by [Universal Treasure Creator] and [Spirit Instrument], he still had to attempt it five times before succeeding. Still, that was much better than his previous attempt.</p>
<p>Han Xiao intended to pass this second mechanical suit to Hila. While this was exclusive equipment for Mechanics and Hila could not enjoy the bonuses attached, Han Xiao only wanted to utilize its transmission function to provide a safety guarantee for Hila.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was not intending to stop at two. Han Xiao had to create a few spare sets for himself and maybe also one set for Ames. The manufacturing time was not the limiting factor now. Rather, the cost was.</p>
<p>The King was equivalent to the cost of an entire fleet, and if it did not reach the Gold Grade, it would be a huge loss. He currently could not guarantee that he could churn out a Universal Treasure Grade each time and would inevitably waste a lot of Enas. Even if the Black Star Army was rich and powerful, the cost pained him.</p>
<p>Han Xiao could not help but sigh. &#8220;As a Mechanic, you can&#8217;t not know how to make money.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at the Attribute Panel. Because it was his second time creating the King, the [Spirit Instrument] did not award him with new God&#8217;s Trait Transformation points, nor did it unlock a new layer of bonuses for him. There was only the benefit of a reallocation for his Attribute Points.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to it being the same blueprint, the efficiency of attribute point reallocation had also decreased, from the previous 200 points to 160 points. It was a pity his Luck did not get reallocated this time, but he received a reallocation from his Charisma, which was not too bad. Anyway, he had always been shameless… He did not care about his face.</p>
<p>The 160 Free Attribute Points were put on standby, and Han Xiao stuffed the second King into a maintenance box for mechanical suits, sending a random mechanical soldier to give it to Hila.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>It was worth mentioning that this special maintenance box was already Orange Grade equipment, which served to nurture the mechanical suit. Placing a mechanical suit inside it for a long time would improve a certain basic attribute of the mechanical suit. As a pinnacle Beyond Grade A Mechanic, everything that Han Xiao used was only the best.</p>
<p>After completing all his work, Han Xiao rubbed his eyes and stretched his waist. He did not have anything to do in camp, and other than dealing with daily tasks, he was only in the workshop repairing his Apostle Weapons and building Universal Treasures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to relax. I shall go and watch the others play cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as Han Xiao was about to walk about, his communicator rang. The indicator showed that it was a call from a high ranking official of the Crimson Dynasty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dynasty is finally willing to contact me. Have they finally come to a conclusion on how to deal with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao&#8217;s eyes flashed, and he accepted the call. A remote projection of a high-ranking official appeared. This was the person-in-charge of contacting Han Xiao, so he was already familiar with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency Black Star.&#8221; The official nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day to you too.&#8221; Han Xiao nodded, and he asked as if unaware, &#8220;What do you have for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh, I know you like things to be handed directly, so I shall not waste your time. The dynasty&#8217;s upper echelons are planning to release a plan related to you, and I would like to obtain your opinions and negotiate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dynasty intends to temporarily open the sales of the Evolutionary Totem to the universe, no longer limiting it to her allies. However, because the Evolution Cube is its energy source and it&#8217;s in your hands, the dynasty wants to know your attitude toward this matter.&#8221; The official smiled.</p>
<p>Han Xiao&#8217;s heart skipped a beat, and an expression of joy spread across his face.</p>
<p>While he knew that there was this probability, having it confirmed gave him a lot of excitement.</p>
<p>All the while, the Crimson Dynasty had controlled the sales channels of the Evolutionary Totem and did not allow it to enter the free market, only allowing her allies to purchase it. This was an agreement between Han Xiao and the dynasty. If these restrictions were lifted, every civilization in the universe would become his customer, which would bring him immense profits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this was not a one-off sale. The Evolutionary Totem could run for up to twenty years, after which it had to be recharged with the Evolution Cube, just like refueling it. Thus, the subsequent maintenance costs could be considered a steady stream of huge benefits, which was like a business opportunity of endless profits.</p>
<p>The Crimson Dynasty had jammed the rights to publicly sell the Evolutionary Totem, wishing to control this income. The only way to do that was to get the Evolution Cube from Han Xiao, as it was unwilling to allow a non-direct ally to control such an important strategic treasure. Thus, both sides had been wrangling over this issue, and their relationship had soured.</p>
<p>Now, the dynasty was finally willing to open up the purchase channels of the Evolutionary Totem and finally made a concession, taking the initiative to ease the relationship between both sides. The reason behind their action was no doubt due to the influence of Black Star&#8217;s Godlike Battle. They were thus willing to temporarily hand over the huge profits to Han Xiao.</p>
<p>While excited, Han Xiao still caught a key point. &#8220;Temporarily? So, how long would that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>The official shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about such exact details. Even the upper echelons probably have not set a date.&#8221;</p>
<p>That meant, the moment he did something wrong, this could all end…</p>
<p>Han Xiao knew that the dynasty&#8217;s move was not only a win-win situation but also an indirect method of control. The moment he got used to the huge gains or the rapid expansion, or when his army could no longer separate itself from the capital flow brought about by this business, the dynasty would have a new way to manipulate him. He also understood this point. After all, the dynasty was a Universal Civilization and would never allow themselves to back off. Now that they were willing to make concessions and show respect, it was good enough for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, I have no objections. When do we begin?&#8221; Han Xiao agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The duration has yet to be determined, but the duration it takes to implement this should take about half a year to a year to prepare. However, within the time of three days to half a month, this decree will be announced to the universe, so we have to quickly agree to a benefits distribution plan,&#8221; the dynasty official stated.</p>
<p>Because the previous cooperation mainly dealt with the dynasty and her allies, there were many preferential discounts. For the sales to the rest of the universe, be it Han Xiao or the dynasty, both wished to inflate the price significantly to fleece the outsiders. Therefore, distribution plans had to be reformulated.</p>
<p>Han Xiao thought for a while before replying. &#8220;In that case… I&#8217;ll have the business team under me contact you directly, and we shall strive to negotiate a suitable result as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Germinal Financial Group under the army had raised a group of business negotiation experts, who could come in handy regarding this matter. Furthermore, he had Iapetus, who was an executive of the financial group and a master in this field.</p>
<p>Because he was holding onto the Evolution Cube, the majority of profits would belong to him, but the dynasty still had to obtain a cut. After all, it had helped to bear the pressure for so long, so he could not act as though they had done nothing. Moreover, the Crimson Dynasty would still provide him assistance in logistics, transportation, and the supply of raw materials in the future. After all, the market of the entire universe was too huge, and the current Black Star Army could not cover the entire universe alone.</p>
<p>Both parties discussed a little more before they hung up. The moment Han Xiao thought of how the army was about to obtain a huge profit channel with a steady stream of money, his good mood took a turn for the better.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a past thought flashed across his mind, and Han Xiao&#8217;s eyes gleamed as a ridiculing smile surfaced.</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment the Crimson Dynasty announces this decree, I can go to the Limitless Financial Group… Heh, you thought that by taking back your commercial suppression on me, everything would go back to normal? How could there be such a good thing in this world!&#8221;</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the Emerald Star Cluster, within an actual combat training ground of the Beast Ancestor&#8217;s stronghold…</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The fist with fingers curled up like the claws of a leopard was entwined in a black energy glow, and it directly connected with the abdomen of a body. The skin and muscles ripped in a ring due to the tremendous force, and the resulting shock wave blew the target away like a cannonball, hitting the wall of the training ground heavily with a bang.</p>
<p>Schneider withdrew his fist, and the toxic energy circling him also faded. He indifferently said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s stop here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not even look at his opponent from the loyalist faction, who had challenged him to a spar but gotten easily defeated. He only picked up the windbreaker he threw to the side before walking out of the training ground.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Schneider would not even bother to respond to the challenges of others, but right now, he was in a bad mood and was venting his frustrations.</p>
<p>Schneider lamented the fact that everyone was now controlled by the Secret Master and forbidden to leave the stronghold.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>At this moment, his communicator rang. He saw that it was a call from his elder sister Jotina.</p>
<p>The moment he connected, Jotina yelled in dissatisfaction, &#8220;When I invited you to leave the Beast Ancestor Organization together, you said to wait and see. Now, even after so long, you haven&#8217;t brought your team and left yet‽ What&#8217;s going on‽&#8221;</p>
<p>Schneider revealed an expression of resignation, and he softly replied, &#8220;Big Sis, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t wish to leave. There&#8217;s been a small incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What incident?&#8221; Jotina frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s His Excellency Secret Master…&#8221; Schneider hesitated upon recalling the imprint that Secret Master put on them, but he resolutely decided to speak the truth. &#8220;He has expressed his intention to help manage the Beast Ancestor&#8217;s troops, and make us work for him. Now, none of us can leave the stronghold, and I&#8217;ve also been trapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jotina was furious as she expected better from him. &#8220;I told you to leave sooner, but you just refused to listen. Now look what happened! You&#8217;re useless! A shame to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She ranted on and on, and Schneider could only mutely accept her cursing.</p>
<p>Because the rebel faction&#8217;s source of hatred was based on the miserable experiences of their birth mothers, they appeared far more humane compared to the other two factions. There was a true brother-sister bond within the people of the faction, and it was the case for Schneider and Jotina. They had grown up together, and Schneider had been afraid of her since he was a child.</p>
<p>Jotina continued to curse for a while before finally holding back when she saw Schneider&#8217;s sullen look. She asked, &#8220;If you&#8217;re unwilling to work under Secret Master, you should find a chance to escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schneider shook his head and sighed. &#8220;The Secret Master has already said that escaping without authorization will be regarded as betrayal, and he has also left a magical imprint on us. Even if we could escape, how could we outrun a Beyond Grade A?&#8221;</p>
<p>Toward the siblings that she recognized, Jotina had a soft heart and could not bear to see Schneider&#8217;s plight. After struggling for a while, she suddenly said, &#8220;Are you willing to join the Black Star Army?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, but there&#8217;s no more chance for me now.&#8221; Schneider sighed.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Jotina gritted her teeth. &#8220;Don&#8217;t lose hope yet. I&#8217;ll go and beg the Army Commander for help!&#8221;</p>
<p>After she spoke, she did not even wait for Schneider to reply, immediately hanging up.</p>
<p>Schneider held onto the communicator with the busy dial tone, a helpless expression on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg Black Star for help? How is that possible/&#8221;</p>
<p>He sighed, not holding any hope at all.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it, as people previously under the flag of the Beast Ancestor, defectors at that, why would Black Star offend another pinnacle Beyond Grade A for Calamity Grades like them?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The former palace of the Beast Ancestor was now converted to a resting place for Secret Master.</p>
<p>Gorutan&#8217;s huge throne had been placed in the Secret Master&#8217;s alchemy storage bottle as a war prize, and he had replaced Gorutan&#8217;s seat with his own throne.</p>
<p>At this moment, Secret Master sat on the throne, browsing the information regarding the officers in the organization, whilst Byram stood at the side, ready to answer a question if needed.</p>
<p>His communicator rang, and when Secret Master glanced at it, his facial expression turned solemn.</p>
<p>His expression as though he had met with a life-threatening situation stunned Byram, and he secretly began guessing who was on the line to cause the Secret Master to show such a drastic expression.</p>
<p>At this moment, Secret Master waved his hand and coldly remarked, &#8220;Leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing that, Byram could only bid his farewell in resignation and leave despite his curiosity. While he considered himself the new confidant of the Secret Master, he did not dare step beyond the rules.</p>
<p>When he was left alone in the room, Secret Master connected to the communication channel with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Star, what are you calling for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao&#8217;s hearty laughter came from the communicator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahaha, Secret Master, you seem to be a little nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secret Master&#8217;s brain was overclocking at the moment. While he wished to befriend Black Star, he could not help having a somewhat guilty conscience.</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled. &#8220;While we had a conflict on the issue of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy, the matter has been resolved. Furthermore, there&#8217;s no enmity between us. If we must say, I also gave you quite a big boon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What boon did you provide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You still need to ask? It&#8217;s the Beast Ancestor. Didn&#8217;t you warn me the other time so that I would get rid of Gorutan? Both of you were Protectors, so there would definitely have been a conflict of interest. Helping you get rid of him means that you can take over his markets. Isn&#8217;t that doing you a favor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you have indirectly helped me.&#8221; Secret Master did not refute it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve helped you, you can help me with a favor that I require now.&#8221; Han Xiao blinked before saying in a meaningful tone, &#8220;I heard that you&#8217;ve taken over the Beast Ancestor&#8217;s troops. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not interested in them. As a twisted melon will never be sweet, I leave it to you to handle them. However, it seems like there are a few who wish to defect. I&#8217;d like you not to restrict those who wish to defect to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secret Master&#8217;s eyes changed slightly. He was a little unwilling to part with these Calamity Grade officers just like that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he chose to give such a concession, there would definitely be other officers who used defecting over to Black Star as an excuse. At that time, should he let them go as well? In this way, his gains from taking over the Beast Ancestor&#8217;s organization would be reduced substantially, and many of the Calamity Grade talents would also be lost.</p>
<p>But since Black Star had called, it meant that he knew of him detaining the Beastmen. If he did not agree, he would end up offending Black Star, and with the latter&#8217;s current tough stance, it might result in conflicts. He still wished to befriend Black Star, but he was not willing to lose too much for it.</p>
<p>While he found it a pity in his heart, Secret Master did not hesitate much. He was not willing to offend Black Star for a few Calamity Grades. &#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll only release those who wish to defect to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221; Han Xiao burst out into a genuine laugh.</p>
<p>The two of them suppressed their inner emotions, pretending to be good friends and brothers, chatting for a while more before hanging up.</p>
<p>The moment he put down the communicator, Secret Master&#8217;s expression collapsed. He summoned Byram and ordered, &#8220;Bring Schneider&#8217;s group over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Byram was a little confused, but he did as he was told.</p>
<p>Very quickly, Schneider and the rebels were gathered in the palace, staring at Secret Master on the throne with a complicated, helpless, and unhappy expression.</p>
<p>Secret Master was expressionless. &#8220;Who here wishes to defect to the Black Star Army?&#8221;</p>
<p>A commotion occurred in the crowd. Everyone looked at each other. What was Secret Master trying to do?</p>
<p>Could this be a test, to kill the chickens in an attempt to warn the monkeys, in order to ward off further rebellious thoughts?</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly turned vigilant, feeling that they had stumbled onto the truth, and rushed to show their loyalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could that be? We&#8217;re willing to accept the protection of Secret Master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all siblings and can communicate easily. I love this place so much, so how could I defect elsewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Secret Master only felt a growing headache.</p>
<p>If it was someone, he could use their current words as an excuse to give a perfunctory response, but Secret Master did not intend to play any tricks on Black Star, so he was currently a little depressed.</p>
<p>The current situation could be described as akin to a drama.</p>
<p>Underlings: &#8220;Secret Master Father, we really do not wish to go to Black Star.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secret Master: &#8220;No, think about it again. Quickly scram to acknowledge your true father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Secret Master regained his calmness. A surge of momentum was released from him, and he solemnly said, &#8220;Less bullsh*t. Those who wish to defect to Black Star, I will not stop you, nor am I toying with you. Those who wish to leave, hurry up and scram.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those people who were still professing their loyalty suddenly felt an irresistible pressure and discovered that the Secret Master was not trying to test them. They all stopped in their tracks, stunned.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the matter? Didn&#8217;t you restrict everyone a while ago. Why are you suddenly freeing us?</p>
<p>Is Secret Master that fickle?</p>
<p>Byram&#8217;s eyes flickered, and he thought about the call that Secret Master had received previously. He came to the conclusion that it was likely Black Star.</p>
<p>To actually sway Secret Master with just a few words, could it be that Secret Master was that afraid of Black Star?</p>
<p>Byram was secretly surprised.</p>
<p>Within the crowd, Schneider suddenly thought of his call with Jotina two hours ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be wrong. Black Star must have played a part in this, or else there&#8217;s no other way to explain it…&#8221;</p>
<p>He discovered that Secret Master&#8217;s expression was quite ugly, as though he was unwilling to do so.</p>
<p>In Schneider&#8217;s view, Jotina had just joined the Black Star Army, and she could not have much sway. For Black Star to help her so unhesitatingly, it had to be because he placed some importance in them.</p>
<p>While he did not know if his conjecture was right, Schneider could not help but feel moved, and he had the urge to even die for Black Star.</p>
<p>It seems like Jotina&#8217;s right. Black Star is indeed a worthy figure to defect to.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Because it was a private deal, the departure of Schneider and the rest did not cause any waves.</p>
<p>It was only seven to eight days later, when the government of the Crimson Dynasty issued a decree without warning, that the entire universe suddenly erupted!</p>
<p>The content of the decree was simple. The dynasty had decided to open up the right to purchase Evolutionary Totems to the entire universe, starting in one year!</p>
<p>The fight between the three Universal Civilizations for the Evolutionary Totem was not a matter that had happened a day or two ago. Thus, when this news was released, it caused massive waves and an uproar. Countless civilizations went crazy.</p>
<p>The dynasty had finally thought it through!</p>
<p>The entire universe, however, knew that the Crimson Dynasty would not make such a move without any motives behind them. For them to come out with such a decision, it likely had to do with the recent matters.</p>
<p>And everyone knew that the recent major matter at the universe-level was Black Star&#8217;s Godlike Battle!</p>
<p>Everyone understood the cause and effect of the two events.</p>
<p>Being shocked by Black Star&#8217;s record, the dynasty had finally compromised and actively given in, allowing Black Star to control the Evolutionary Totem business with his Evolution Cube!</p>
<p>A Universal Civilization, especially a stubborn boss such as the Crimson Dynasty, actually compromised for a Beyond Grade A!</p>
<p>When had this last happened‽</p>
<p>When they figured this out, the countless Galactic Civilizations and residents were shocked beyond words.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the Arcane Church and the Federation of Light were delighted.</p>
<p>By showing his prestige, Black Star had moved the Crimson Dynasty to open up the Evolutionary Totem sales. For this reason, it was worthwhile for them to have lost a few Beyond Grade As.</p>
<p>We were walking on the wrong path all along!</p>
<p>If they had known that putting pressure of the dynasty would not be of use, they would have just sent a bunch of people over to Black Star, allowing him to rack up an incredible battle record. Then, they would have gotten their desires that much earlier!</p>
<p>The dynasty&#8217;s decree set off a wave of public opinion across the universe, further skyrocketing Han Xiao&#8217;s records and personal prestige. He alone now overwhelmed the rays given off by all Beyond Grade As.</p>
<p>While the news and rumors were spreading like wildfire throughout the universe, the Limitless Financial Group&#8217;s branch within the Flickering World welcomed an unexpected guest.</p></div>            </div>

				<h3>Chapter 867 Demonstration</h3>
<p>The action plan was finalized. The dynasty troops would split into three sections; Milizaus and his group would take the captives back, Tarrokov would remain to command the fleet, and Han Xiao and Heber would clean up any loose ends by going to the Star Pupil Holy Race together.</p>
<p>Watching the dynasty’s fleet leave, Han Xiao turned to look at Heber on the virtual screen of his spaceship and smiled.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be partners again this time. When we arrive at the Star Pupil Holy Race, I hope you can live up to your namesake and be more tyrannical.”</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>“Humph.”</p>
<p>The virtual screen turned dark as Heber cut the connection, not deigning to speak with him. From the porthole, one could see the Bloodshed Land’s troops turn and leave, morphing into rays of light.</p>
<p>Han Xiao clicked his tongue before calling Sylvia.</p>
<p>“Get Herlous to send a fleet to this meeting point. I’ve gotten Phillip to transfer the coordinates over to you.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<p>With this simple conversation over, Han Xiao cut the call. He realized that Sylvia was getting more and more capable, with him practically not needing to worry any longer.</p>
<p>“It feels as though I’m becoming more and more like Ames, turning into a arm-flinging shopkeeper[1]…”</p>
<p>As he played with his communicator, he could not resist bursting into laughter. He realized that if he were to turn into Ames, then Sylvia would become his Jenny.</p>
<div></div>
<p>To think that the heroic Mechanical Lady Knight of his past life had turned into an army affairs officer and head secretary. He did not know which the players would find more attractive, though he knew that Sylvia’s favorability within the players was currently quite high.</p>
<p>This moment, Mad Sky Hunter took the initiative to lean over to Han Xiao, nudging him with its head. Han Xiao’s mouth curled, and he proceeded to stroke the brain portion of Mad Sky Hunter, causing it to let out happy noises as it lowered its head, just like an actual pet getting petted.</p>
<p>Mad Sky Hunter would only behave like this in front of Han Xiao, its creator. As a beast-type Mechanical Life, its mannerisms had deviated a little from the norm. Upon accessing its web records, Han Xiao discovered that other than the combat resources, it had also downloaded dozens of pet videos from the internet. Most likely, it was attempting to learn how to behave like a pet, but its actions coupled with its sleek, glossy demeanor only served to give Han Xiao goosebumps.</p>
<p>If he really did pet it, the feeling he would get from his hands would be just plain weird. However, if he did not pet it, it would seem like he was not showing respect to its hard work.</p>
<p>Silver Flash stood coldly by the side, secretly showing disdain.</p>
<p>Humph, boot-licker!</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>Thinking about it, Han Xiao dialed Ames, and her elegant face soon appeared in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I have a mission here, which is to go to the Star Pupil Holy Race to bully Psyker. Are you interested?”</p>
<p>Ames supported her chin with her right hand, and her sleeves dropped down, revealing dazzling white skin. She blinked.</p>
<p>“I’ve realized that you seldom chat with me these days unless you have some business.”</p>
<p>“Are you coming or not?”</p>
<p>“Let me check my schedule.” Ames lifted her eyes, gazing past the screen toward someone by the side. She slowly asked, “Jenny, is there anything on Floating Dragon that I need to do?”</p>
<p>It took a long while before a brittle voice coupled with grinding teeth sounded.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“There is… but have you ever done it?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ames directly waved her hand. Han Xiao could not see what happened, but Jenny’s voice seemed to have disappeared. Maybe… she got attacked by Ames’ force field.</p>
<p>“Looks like I’m free. I’ll head over.” Ames looked like she was smiling yet not smiling, as though nothing had happened on her side.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Han Xiao nodded his hand, choosing to ignore whatever had just happened.</p>
<p>“This is the mission assigned by the dynasty, so I believe it won’t be just you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Heber is involved this time, together with a few dynasty fleets.”</p>
<p>“Heber is going too?” Ames narrowed her eyes. “Humph, I don’t want to even see him. I’m not going. You can have fun with him.”</p>
<p>Ames immediately cut the call off.</p>
<p>Han Xiao blinked in surprise, staring at the black screen in confusion.</p>
<p>Does she have that great a misgiving toward Heber, to just go back on her word like that‽</p>
<p>It seemed like he had underestimated how badly Heber failed in his attempt to use an iron-blooded man’s method of courtship.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While the Crimson Dynasty was ferrying the four captives back, and their prestige was sweeping across the universe, the Star Pupil Holy Race within the Eternal Night Star System greeted an unexpected visitor.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Psyker held the highest authority here, and the Cabinet of ministers assisted him in managing government affairs. Some of the key personnel were high-levelled officials who held real power. This system obviously had drawbacks, but this was not a problem for Psyker. His strength and prestige granted him the right to speak, and because of his psychic ability, he was able to differentiate between thoughts and emotions, so no one could override him.</p>
<p>During this time, Psyker was not within the government, so the cabinet was in charge of daily matters. However, the two parties did not completely cut off their connection. While Psyker was on the run, he kept monitoring the affairs of his race. It was just that he was not at home, nor was he able to reveal his face openly. However, the public opinion surrounding him recently let many of the citizens in the Star Pupil Holy Race feel trepidation.</p>
<p>In particular, the dynasty catching Sagman and Taylor had attracted the worry of the Star Pupil Holy Race. They were afraid that their leader would also be snatched away and frightened that the Crimson Dynasty would turn toward the Star Pupil Holy Race for revenge.</p>
<p>Filled with all kinds of worries, a minority of people were secretly cursing Psyker.</p>
<p>Were you so free that you had to go and muddy the waters, making it so messy now!</p>
<p>This public opinion had been widely circulated among the Star Pupil Holy Race. A small group of people faced threats to their own security, so they were dissatisfied with their leader, Psyker. As for Psyker’s past credits, it did not make a difference in their judgement because people tended to take things that were given to them for granted. It was a pity that Psyker did not succeed, or else the direction of public opinion would have been the opposite, praising him.</p>
<p>However, the extreme views of the minority would not be able to affect the stability of the civilization. Psyker’s control over his race was not just made up of glue, and even if the future was unknown, the government was still operating.</p>
<p>The cabinet set down instructions to let people preach online that Psyker was in this situation in order to recapture their clan treasure, in order to shape Psyker’s image of taking risks personally for the dignity of their race. This severely suppressed a batch of dissatisfied remarks.</p>
<p>At this moment, in the main hall of the cabinet, many key officials were discussing whether to enter a higher level of wartime emergency, inviting Psyker back and using troops to protect him.</p>
<p>A great number of senior military officials were participating in this meeting, each holding their own opinions and arguing fiercely.</p>
<p>At this moment, one of the officials received an intelligence report and suddenly had a change in expression, slamming the table as he read out the report.</p>
<p>“Border Post 17 has detected a large dynasty fleet with tens of millions of battleships, including Black Star Army and Bloodshed Land troops.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“What‽”</p>
<p>All the members present were shocked and horrified.</p>
<p>Did the worst situation happen, and the dynasty troops had really chosen to kill their way over?</p>
<p>Before they could react, the second report arrived.</p>
<p>“The other party has stopped at the border and did not forcibly intrude. They are now negotiating with the border officer. Black Star and Tyrant are commanding this fleet, and their intentions are unknown.”</p>
<p>The hearts that were in the cabinet members’ throats slowly fell back down. They stared at the officer with grudging eyes.</p>
<p>Could you not speak in such an emotional tone? You nearly scared us to death!</p>
<p>After their shock subsided, everyone’s senses came back online.</p>
<p>“That’s right. With such tens of millions of battleships, it doesn’t seem like they came here to declare war.”</p>
<p>“What’s their intentions? Could it be that they’re going to force us to hand over our leader?”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“This… What do we do then? Won’t we still clash with them that way?”</p>
<p>All the people present had on difficult expressions.</p>
<p>Very quickly, the third report was sent over.</p>
<p>“Black Star and the Tyrant have said that they came over to visit the Star Pupil Holy Race, and they wish to talk to Psyker.”</p>
<p>The cabinet members looked at each other.</p>
<p>With such a mighty army, they’re saying that they’ve come here for a visit. Do they think we’re fools?</p>
<p>The fleet clearly did not come with good intentions.</p>
<p>“If we reject their request, do you think they will wait outside the border, or will they resort to violence?” one of the cabinet members asked.</p>
<p>Everyone simply stared at the person wordlessly.</p>
<p>Do you think that the troops and Beyond Grade As sent out by the dynasty are here for sightseeing? Giving them the cold shoulder is akin to refusing a toast and choosing the forfeit instead. How could they possibly take it lying down?</p>
<div></div>
<p>Brother, how did you get into the cabinet? Did you pull strings?</p>
<p>“This matter is already out of our scope of authority. Report to Leader Psyker and let him decide.”</p>
<p>The cabinet then contacted the escaping Psyker.</p>
<p>Not long after, the communication was linked.</p>
<p>Surveying the scene, Psyker noticed their heavy expressions and asked, “What’s happened?”</p>
<p>“Leader, the Crimson Dynasty has come to pressure us…” One of the officers explained the matter once more.</p>
<p>After he finished, the room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Everyone was waiting for his response.</p>
<p>Psyker took a deep breath, closing his eyes. After a while, he slowly opened them.</p>
<p>“Receive them. I’ll rush back right now.”</p>
<p>“But they are targeting you!”</p>
<p>A few of the people had panicked expressions, but they secretly heaved sighs of relief.</p>
<p>If Psyker had chosen to run and not come out to take responsibility for this matter, there would have been no way for them to clear up this mess.</p>
<p>“Their method of doing so is just to force me to return. Black Star and Heber understand me. They know that I would not leave my race and escape.” Psyker’s expression turned calm. “There’s no point in running, and I have to face them sooner or later. This is the price of failure.”</p>
<p>Those present all revealed faces of indignation.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, the dynasty already has four captives. Them visiting the Star Pupil Holy Race might not be to capture me.” Psyker shook his head.</p>
<p>He did not dare return, other than to observe the situation, because he expected the dynasty not to take the risk to violate the Peace Treaty. While his base was situated there, the dynasty would definitely not go head to head against him just to capture him. He just did not wish to put his race in danger, so he was not willing to accept the protection of his civilization’s troops. However, to prevent any problems, he did not move too far away and had always been hovering near his territory.</p>
<p>“Understood. We’ll open the border and escort them to one of the planets,” one of the commanders solemnly replied.</p>
<p>The security of one’s territory was important, but they also had to take the initiative to open the border and meet with more aggressive guests. The dynasty’s faction was undoubtedly exerting pressure, and everyone was placed in a state of unease.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Before long, the Star Pupil Holy Race sent troops over to the border to welcome them, and other than a large portion of the Crimson Dynasty troops remaining at the border, Han Xiao and Heber brought some troops and followed the Star Pupil Holy Race troops to a colonial planet.</p>
<p>The Star Pupil Holy Race evidently did not want to let too many people discover this matter, so the spaceships stopped directly within the inner administrative area of the planet. Before the emissary that was qualified to receive the two arrived, the local lord of the colonial planet performed the reception work himself.</p>
<p>After disembarking from the spaceship, Han Xiao and Heber were led to the reception room. Following from behind, Han Xiao could see that they were on edge, and beads of sweat could be seen trickling down his neck.</p>
<p>The surrounding soldiers were also nervous and alert, staring at Han Xiao and Heber with a death gaze while gripping their weapons tightly.</p>
<p>Heber was used to such fear coming from people and took large steps with his Vanguard Officials following close behind. This group often gave off a strange impression, as though they were going to shout out “Fitness is key!” at any given moment.</p>
<p>On Han Xiao’s side, he was observing the architectural style of the Star Pupil Holy Race casually, with Hila, his Black Star Guards, and the four Apostle Weapons behind him.</p>
<p>They both had brought their own Calamity Grade elites, as well as many officers from the Crimson Dynasty.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, everyone took their seats, and the local lord wiped his sweat, carefully saying, “The Emissary is on his way. Please hold on for a moment.”</p>
<p>Heber was akin to a tiny mountain as he sat on the sofa. He had a pressuring aura, his arms folded as he asked, “When will Psyker return?”</p>
<p>“This… this… I do not know…”</p>
<p>The local lord was pressured by his momentum to the point his throat was locked in place. He barely managed to speak, his sweat beginning to flow again like a waterfall.</p>
<p>Han Xiao casually picked up one of the fruits on the table, which looked like a melon that was dyed blue. He bit into it and chewed a few times, before wiping his mouth and flicking it toward Heber.</p>
<p>“I’ve tried it. There’s no poison, so you can eat in peace.”</p>
<p>Heber’s face twitched.</p>
<p>I’m over here trying to posture, yet you threw me the fruit. You’re totally spoiling this atmosphere!</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’m a pugilist. Why would I need a mechanic like you to test for poison‽</p>
<p>The fruit was already thrown over, and it would not be good to let it drop on the ground. Thus, Heber could only catch it and then fling it to one of his Vanguard Officials behind him.</p>
<p>This time, Heber could not be bothered to speak and only closed his eyes. Han Xiao did not press the issue either, half closing his eyes as he enjoyed the feeling of Aurora massaging his temples.</p>
<p>The atmosphere thus quieted down.</p>
<p>While the surrounding guards were at the ready, after seeing the nonchalant attitudes of the duo, they had to suppress their rage.</p>
<p>Atrocious, these people are not showing the Star Pupil Holy Race the slightest respect!</p>
<p>Especially Black Star, this evildoer. Not only did he steal our clan treasure, he actually dared run over to our territory. How arrogant!</p>
<p>The guards held onto the weapons tight, almost wanting to shoot at Han Xiao. However, their reasoning stopped them.</p>
<p>The situation was more important than the people. The dynasty was going whatever they wanted in the Shattered Star Ring, and their backer, the Arcane Church, had also suffered losses, so they naturally would not dare make any rash moves.</p>
<p>Very soon, the surrounding guards swapped shifts, and Calamity Grades took over as the guards. They stared unceasingly at Han Xiao and Heber as though meeting their mortal enemies.</p>
<p>After a period of time, hurried footsteps could be heard from the door, and an emissary soon walked in with a few of his subordinates.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Black Star, Your Excellency Heber, Crimson Dynasty emissaries, I’m the person in charge of welcoming you. You may refer to me as Jed.”</p>
<p>Jed slightly bowered, but his tone was neither arrogant nor humble.</p>
<p>Heber opened his eyes again and again asked, “When will Psyker arrive?”</p>
<p>“We’re not too sure ourselves. The leader has his own schedule and may take as little as several days to half a month. Please wait for a while. We’ll provide accommodation if both of you wish to stay,” Jed blandly replied.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The pressure around Heber’s body intensified, and the room seemed as though a formless hurricane had been born within it.</p>
<p>He coldly stared at Jed as he spoke,</p>
<p>“Don’t try to play dumb. Psyker has always been hovering around the Star Pupil Holy Race and will not be too far away. I’ll give you three days. If I do not see him in person, you can handle the consequences yourself.”</p>
<p>Jed only felt his breathing become labored. He was pressured to the point he could hardly breathe and could only nod with difficulty. “I’ll convey your intentions to the upper echelons…”</p>
<p>At this time, Han Xiao opened his eyes, gesturing for Aurora to stop, before looking interestedly at Jed.</p>
<p>“I just took a gander around your network and realized that your side seems to be very keen to block off the news. Not many of them know that we came over for a visit.”</p>
<p>Upon thinking of Han Xiao’s ability, Jed’s expression changed. “What do you intend to do?”</p>
<p>“It’s no good to withhold information like that. Let me help you guys.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled, and with a thought, the data packet that Phillip had prepared was immediately sent to the major media channels of the Star Pupil Holy Race and forcibly promoted.</p>
<p>It could be roughly summarized as…</p>
<p>‘The dynasty fleet comes to settle accounts, Star Pupil Holy Race trembles in fear!’</p>
<p>‘Black Star and the Tyrant show up, but Psyker dares not meet them!’</p>
<p>‘Psyker flees due to his crimes, leaving behind his race!’</p>
<p>All of the articles showed the Star Pupil Holy Race in a cowardly light and how Psyker did not dare take responsibility, which made the citizens of the race feel suffocated, cracking the prestige of Psyker.</p>
<p>With his current Virtual Technology skills, this news instantly broke the barriers of public opinion that were silenced and swept through the entire network of the Star Pupil Holy Race.</p>
<p>Psyker had brought him a huge crisis this time, and now that he had come over on behalf of the dynasty to apply pressure, Han Xiao would naturally not be polite. Only when Psyker showed himself would he then command Phillip to stop.</p>
<p>Jed walked to the side, and after exchanging a few sentences with the upper echelons, he approached Han Xiao with a strict expression.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Black Star, please stop such behavior, or else…”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Before he could finish, Jed’s head was captured by a large hand and ruthlessly slammed on the table.</p>
<p>The entire table cracked!</p>
<p>The person holding onto his head was a Vanguard Official of Bloodshed Land, Fosters. He coldly commented, “Watch your attitude when you speak to us. If there’s a next time, I’ll break your head apart.”</p>
<p>The moment the grip was released, Jed stumbled and retreated, a furious expression on his face.</p>
<p>However, he had no choice but to swallow this injustice. He took out his handkerchief to wipe off the blue blood flowing down his head.</p>
<p>When the Calamity Grades saw them being so arrogant, their faces got uglier, and the rage smoldered within their hearts. However, because this impacted the entire race, they chose not to move, instead keeping the resentment within their hearts.</p>
<p>Han Xiao raised his eyebrows as he gestured at Heber. He seemed to be saying, If you compare viciousness, you’re still more vicious.</p>
<p>Look at how much bullsh*t you have to say, Heber seemed to reply with a look.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the news caused a sensation on the internet. Countless citizens burst into anger, some scolding the dynasty for taking advantage and others smearing the name of their leader. Some of them were also worried that Psyker would never return. There were innumerable emotions.</p>
<p>Countless people wished to recapture their national treasure, so the hatred the Star Pupil Holy Race had toward Han Xiao was not light. Han Xiao did not care about the hostility, though, as the more hostile they were, the more it meant that Psyker’s prestige was affected.</p>
<p>Jed did not speak, but one of the guards could not take it any longer and suddenly lashed out at Han Xiao.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have a conscience! After stealing our clan treasure, you dare come here and flaunt it!”</p>
<p>After this sentence was spoken, everyone turned over.</p>
<p>A chilling gaze passed through Hila’s eyes, and she was just about to move. However, Han Xiao gestured for her to hold back and turned to look at the guard.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Lalem!” The guard was obviously out of control and extremely emotional.</p>
<p>“Hmm, ok, then what would you have me do?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you should return our national treasure!”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Han Xiao nodded, taking out the Evolution Cube and throwing it into the guard’s hands. “Catch.”</p>
<p>Everyone from the Star Pupil Holy Race was stunned, staring incredulously at the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>“You, you…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you wanted it? Now it’s in your hands.” Han Xiao smiled. “However, I have to warn you. If you walk out of this room, it means that you have snatched the Evolution Cube, and that would mean that the dynasty would send their expeditionary fleet over. Are you ready to handle that?”</p>
<p>The guard’s face turned purple in anger and humiliation.</p>
<p>“You’re just relying on your backer! Do you have any morality in your heart‽”</p>
<p>Lifting his hand, Han Xiao retrieved the Evolutionary Cube, shaking his head as he spoke. “You all claim that it’s your national treasure, but this thing was not created by you. Just by using it for a long period of time, it becomes yours, huh? This is the inheritance of the Evolutionary Civilization, and you guys are the same in that you picked it up, holding on through strength. It never belonged to you, yet you call it your ‘national treasure’… There’s also another point. I did not snatch your Evolutionary Cube. It was you guys who lost it, and I picked it up. I merely refused to hand it over to others, just like you guys so many years ago. This question of stance should not be used as an excuse for morality. That would be so meaningless.”</p>
<p>“Bullsh*t. We’ve used the Evolution Cube for so long and can be considered its owner. Leader Psyker has always been connected to the Evolution Cube, so of course it’s ours!” the guard raged.</p>
<p>“This does make sense, but since you guys failed to guard your belongings, it was stolen by EsGod. I didn’t steal it; I merely chose not to return it. Furthermore, because this item was not the creation of your civilization, I have no mental burden toward withholding it for myself… If you guys can snatch it back from me, I can’t do anything about it, but your strength is insufficient, so anything else you say is meaningless. I gave you a chance, but you didn’t dare take it away. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head. He had never been a kind person, and he had another motive here, which was to resolve the hidden danger of the Evolution Cube once and for all. He planned to use pressure to force the citizens and Psyker to lift their psychic link with it!</p>
<p>As for right or wrong… Psyker had endangered his life many times. Now that things had gotten to this point, there was no need to worry about this issue.</p>
<p>“You, leave.” Jed waved toward the guard. While he was also furious about losing the ‘national treasure’, he was more realistic and knew that the dynasty had come to pressure them. It would be a pipe dream to make them hand over the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>Having witnessed this little spat, Heber threw a glance over to Han Xiao.</p>
<p>“You’re not too bad at being evil yourself.”</p>
<p>“As to you.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao rolled his eyes in response.</p>
<p>One needed to be more arrogant when posturing to apply pressure. For someone like him, who was used to being low-key, this was difficult to do.</p>
<p>[1] He’s referring to a leader that only delegates work but never does any</p>

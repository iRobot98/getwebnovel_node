				<p><strong>749 It Will Not Be So Easy! </strong></p>
<p>When the reinforcements led by Psyker arrived on Planet Avitan, the first EsGod doppelganger had already destroyed more than twenty cities, causing heavy casualties, and was still remolding the surface of Planet Avitan.</p>
<p>The fleet stopped in the orbit of Planet Avitan. Psyker flew out of his spaceship and floated at the front of the fleet. He looked down at the planet surface filled with wreckages, and an immense amount of rage appeared in his eyes.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>Normally, those of the Star Pupil Holy Race had four arms, three eyes, and smooth azure skin. Their organs were also different from the human race. They had two brains and five hearts, and they had no totally lethal weaknesses. Under the influence of the Evolution Cube, their genes were outstanding. Their bone structure, muscles, and blood vessels were all enhanced. Although they were not at the level of rare Universe Species yet, even the normal members of the Star Pupil Holy Race could survive in space with just their body.</p>
<p>Psyker&#8217;s appearance, however, was very different from his people. He had awoken the ancestor genes in his body, so he looked more ferocious. He had seven eyes on his face, among which six formed a diamond shape surrounding his main eye. His eye was like a black gem, flickering with infinite stars as if it had a galaxy in it.</p>
<p>He had long, white hair, but it was not actually his hair but countless tentacles as thin as hairs that could sense things. A pair of straight, snow-white horns with jade texture extended from his forehead. His shoulders, chest, wrist, knees, back, and several other places were covered by a naturally grown white exoskeleton, like he was wearing skeleton armor. His azure skin was filled with dark purple patterns. Three pairs of pipeline-looking bone limbs grew from his back, looking like the skeleton of wings when they were opened.</p>
<p>Of course, as the leader of a civilization, Psyker was not naked. He wore a gorgeous, tailored robe.</p>
<p>The next moment, Psyker dived right toward the planet&#8217;s surface. The first EsGod doppelganger noticed and stopped on a wasteland. He then looked up and looked at Psyker as he landed in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;EsGod, I know you can hear me. You threw your doppelganger to my territory. Do you want to be my enemy?&#8221; Psyker demanded in a cold tone.</p>
<p>He had once travelled to other Star Fields and had knowledge of all the Beyond Grade As in the Galaxy, so he had recognized this as EsGod&#8217;s doppelganger long ago.</p>
<p>The red dot on the doppelganger&#8217;s face flickered as EsGod took control of him. Through the doppelganger, EsGod smiled and said, &#8220;You know why I&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that as long as you lure me out, you will definitely be able to snatch away my treasure?&#8221; Psyker sneered and instantly pointed out EsGod&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>He was the leader of a civilization, so he was clearly not stupid. For a notorious Beyond Grade A brute of the Central Galaxy to suddenly appear in the Shattered Star Ring and cause destruction in his territory, it was not because EsGod just wanted to have fun. His Evolution Cube was desired by tons of people. As soon as Psyker saw the news on the mother planet, he had known what EsGod&#8217;s goal was—it could only be the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>However, even though he clearly knew that leaving his mother planet would mean he was completely following EsGod&#8217;s plan, he had no other choices. No one would be able to stop the EsGod doppelganger from destroying Planet Avitan if he did not come.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how strong someone is, as long as he cares for something, he will forever have weaknesses.&#8221; The EsGod doppelganger smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the point of being strong if one has no goal to stand by?&#8221;</p>
<p>Psyker&#8217;s seven eyes narrowed simultaneously. An enormous amount of psychic energy shot up the sky. His voice suddenly became solemn and holy, as if it filled the entire sky.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I indeed have no way to ignore your trap, but as long as I kill you quickly, luring me away will be meaningless!&#8221;</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As soon as his sentence ended, EsGod doppelganger No.l punched forward with both fists. A maroon energy wave ejected from his fists. The ground cracked open, and the already heavily damaged lands started to vibrate violently, gradually shattering.</p>
<p>Esper Ability—Destructive Dark Energy!</p>
<p>Psyker completely ignored the approaching tsunami-like energy wave. A light shot out from his seven eyes at the same time. Invisible psychic energy turned into countless needles and shot right toward the energy wave.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Like fireworks, the energy wave exploded. Though colorful and dazzling, it was extremely dangerous. The energy emitted dug out one rift after another from the ground. Everywhere they passed, even the mud turned to ash.</p>
<p>Psh!</p>
<p>The psychic energy penetrated the explosion and landed on the EsGod doppelganger. His body violently exploded and turned into a cluster of black fog in an instant. In the black fog, a red dot of light flickered—this was the core of the EsGod doppelganger.</p>
<p>The next moment, all the black fog condensed around the red dot and turned back into the doppelganger but thinner.</p>
<p>Psyker&#8217;s psychic energy happened to be able to deal the most damage to the core of the EsGod doppelganger. Even the EsGod doppelganger would not be able to endure attacks from Beyond Grade As with ease, not to mention the fact that the EsGod doppelganger had already used quite a lot of its energy.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>The battle between Beyond Grade As shattered the sky and the earth, mainly because the EsGod doppelganger did not care about the damage caused at all and released his energy without holding back.</p>
<p>On the other side, Psyker&#8217;s ability would not cause too much impact. It looked like the EsGod doppelganger&#8217;s attacks were much more horrifying, but in reality, he was no match for Psyker.</p>
<p>After all, he was just a doppelganger. There was no way he would be able to beat a true Beyond Grade A Super in his full form.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>For the next few minutes, they fought intensely. The EsGod doppelganger was turned into a cluster of black fog time after time and barely reformed his body afterward. The red dot of light flickered constantly as if it would disappear at any moment.</p>
<p>As Psyker was about to maintain his momentum and completely destroy this doppelganger, he suddenly sensed a new Beyond Grade A energy source, and he instantly looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>The other EsGod doppelganger that had been hiding for a very long time on Planet Avitan finally appeared. He was now attacking the fleet in the orbit of the planet.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, I won&#8217;t be able to stop you with just one of my doppelgangers,&#8221; EsGod said through the doppelganger, &#8220;but if it&#8217;s two of them, stalling you for a short period won&#8217;t be a problem. After I destroy your fleet and your spaceship, you won&#8217;t be able to rush back to your mother planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>You talk too much!&#8221; Psyker&#8217;s eyes became firm. He did not want to waste time by speaking and immediately overwhelmed the first EsGod doppelganger with his psychic energy.</p>
<p>Psyker did not panic. He was not worried about the Evolution Cube being stolen at all. He felt that EsGod only knew that the Evolution Cube was a Universal Treasure but most likely had no idea what the Evolution Cube really was.</p>
<p>The Evolution Cube was very strange, and it was enormous. He was not able to carry it along even after studying it for so long. Unless it was directly snatched away from him, the possibility of it being stolen was next to nothing. This was also why he was confident enough to leave his mother planet and go there.</p>
<p>Of course, Psyker did not know about EsGod&#8217;s true trump card.</p>
<p>On the Star Pupil Holy Race Mother Planet, while Psyker was being stalled by two doppelgangers, the remaining EsGod doppelganger acted. Using its teleportation Esper ability, it teleported Colin, Orozen, and the others to where the Evolution Cube was stored.</p>
<p>An extremely strong, blinding light!</p>
<p>When they finally adapted to the blinding light around them, they finally looked around.</p>
<p>This was a strange area. They were shrouded by a light green protective shield released by the EsGod doppelganger, and everywhere outside of it was filled with a hot, viscous liquid.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this place?&#8221; Orozen wondered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outer core of the Star Pupil Holy Race Mother Planet,&#8221; the EsGod doppelganger said with a calm tone.</p>
<p>Psyker had hidden the Evolution Cube in the inner core of his mother planet and covered it with his psychic barrier, blocking the majority of detection abilities. If not because the Evolutionary Civilization recorded the method to locate the Evolution Cube, the EsGod doppelganger would not have been able to directly teleport there.</p>
<p>After confirming the location, the EsGod doppelganger used his psychic Esper ability to melt the barrier left by Psyker.</p>
<p>The next moment, a gigantic metallic object appeared before everyone&#8217;s eyes out of nowhere.</p>
<p>They did not know how huge this object was. All they knew was that they could only see one side of the Evolution Cube, and they could not even see the end of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is way too huge.&#8221; Colin&#8217;s pupils constricted.</p>
<p>Curious, Orozen reached out and touched the Evolution Cube, but his hand entered the Evolution Cube unobstructed, as if the Evolution Cube was just a projection with no physical form.</p>
<p>The physical state of the Evolution Cube was very strange. It was between material and energy. It could not be touched by usual means.</p>
<p>&#8220;The information says as long as someone&#8217;s entire body enters the Evolution Cube, they will evolve inside. That&#8217;s the simplest way to use it.&#8221; Orozen was tempted.</p>
<p>Colin was a little tempted, but he still remembered the mission. &#8220;Stop wasting time. Quickly contain it with the device.&#8221; One of the people quickly took out a silver, palm-sized cube and passed it to Colin.</p>
<p>This was a device that EsGod had built following the information left behind by the Evolutionary Civilization. Like a container to store water, its only use was to carry the enormous Evolution Cube and make it portable.</p>
<p>This was special technology possessed by the Evolutionary Civilization that had been lost for a long time. EsGod, who possessed information of this civilization, was the only one that could build this device!</p>
<p>Without this device, stealing the Evolution Cube would be an almost impossible mission.</p>
<p>Colin raised up the silver cube and activated it.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>The silver cube suddenly emitted a gentle light.</p>
<p>The enormous Evolution Cube seemed to have sensed something. It suddenly shook, and the next moment, a black beam suddenly shot out from the side that was facing them, like it was a pipe.</p>
<p>The Evolution Cube started to turn itself into pure energy. Through this pipe, it slowly &#8216;squeezed&#8217; itself into the silver cube, as if it had finally found a home.</p>
<p>The Evolution Cube in the outside world started to shrink. It was as if the silver cube was slowly drinking the Evolution Cube from a straw.</p>
<p>Seeing that the device worked, Colin felt relieved. &#8220;The process should take a few minutes. We have more than enough time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as his sentence ended, a ton of pale white light clusters appeared in their peripheral vision and quickly headed toward them. If not because they were all Supers, they would not have even noticed these inconspicuous ligM among all this blinding light.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are those?&#8221; Colin&#8217;s expression changed drastically, and he was instantly alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected,&#8221; the EsGod doppelganger said, &#8220;Psyker has a backup plan. These clusters are all his psychic energy. Every one of them is equivalent to one Beyond Grade A psychic attack. This is to protect the Evolution Cube and will attack all intruders. You guys focus on the Evolution Cube; I will stop these things!&#8221;</p>
<p>Every one of these psychic energy clusters had strength equal to the one-time psychic weapon that had been used on Han Xiao. At this moment, more and more energy clusters appeared continuously and swamped toward them.</p>
<p>The EsGod doppelganger opened an invisible psychic shield that shrouded everyone.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The psychic energy clusters landed on the shield one after another like pouring rain landing on a lake, causing countless ripples on the surface of the psychic shield.</p>
<p>The EsGod doppelganger&#8217;s red dot core dimmed at a visible rate. His energy was being consumed extremely quickly while enduring so many Beyond Grade A psychic attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quickly…quickly…&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone was anxious as they stared at the silver cube slowly absorbing the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>They knew that once the EsGod doppelganger was destroyed, they would certainly die.</p>
<p>Seconds felt like years while they waited. Fortunately, although the Evolution Cube&#8217;s physical state was weird. It was still a whole object. When the silver cube absorbed a large enough portion of the Evolution Cube, it started absorbing the rest at a much quicker rate.</p>
<p>Finally, the last bit of the Evolution Cube turned into energy and entered the silver cube. The absorption was complete, and the cube turned from silver to black.</p>
<p>This was the Evolution Cube in its complete form!</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done!&#8221; Colin hastily shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; The EsGod doppelganger could not hold on anymore. Using the last bits of his energy, he sent everyone else back to the spaceship and immediately cut off the teleportation gate.</p>
<p>The next moment, this doppelganger could no longer maintain the shield and was devoured by the energy clusters, disappearing instantly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he had completed his mission of protecting his subordinates till they stole the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>Doppelgangers had limited energy. Only those subordinates of his could cross the desolate universe belt and take the item back to the Fallen Ark. EsGod&#8217;s original did not dare leave the Central Galaxy casually. The three Universal Civilizations had their eyes on him at all times. If his original made a move, he would not have been able to hide this mission, and things would have been much more difficult.</p>
<p>With a flash before their eyes, Colin and the others were teleported back to the spaceships. Before they could speak, their attention was attracted by the loud alarm inside the spaceship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh*t, our spaceships have been discovered. The Star Pupil Holy Race has sent a fleet to attack us!&#8221;</p>
<p>The expression on their faces became worse instantly.</p>
<p>Three &#8216;Light Fox&#8217; spaceships were surrounded by a large number of Star Pupil Holy Race battleships. Their shields were swamped with attacks.</p>
<p>When they were stealing the Evolution Cube, Psyker had sensed it. He had quickly ordered the military stationed on his mother planet to do a thorough search of the universe space around. When the EsGod doppelganger was eliminated, the three spaceships lost their stealth barrier and were finally discovered by the Star Pupil Holy Race. They were instantly besieged by the fleet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quickly, leave!&#8221;</p>
<p>Colin had no time to observe the Evolution Cube and quickly piloted the spaceship to dodge the attacks.</p>
<p>The three spaceships parted ways, and one spaceship was soon destroyed.</p>
<p>Relying on the spaceships&#8217; powerful engines, the two remaining spaceships entered high-speed hyperdrive and escaped. The armor of the spaceships was covered in damages.</p>
<p>Colin gasped for air. When they entered hyperdrive, his tense body finally relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We escaped. With our speed, the enemies won&#8217;t be able to catch up,&#8221; Colin said with a low voice. &#8220;Activate spaceship diagnostics, calculate damages.&#8221;</p>
<p>The artificial intelligence of the spaceship replied with stutter, &#8220;Tsss&#8230; self-diagnosing&#8230; Ship body damage at sixty- three percent. Shield generator close to broken. Energy furnace damaged moderately. Power output decreased by forty-two percent&#8230; Tsss&#8230; Thruster damage at thirty-eight percent. Engines No.4 and No.6 are close to broken. Selfrepair device malfunctioning&#8230; Immediate repair of the spaceship is suggested. With the current state of the spaceship, it can&#8217;t stay in hyperdrive much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orozen grinned and said, &#8220;Stealing something from a Beyond Grade A was so exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what, we have what we came for.&#8221; Colin glanced at the Evolution Cube that was now palm sized. &#8220;The spaceship can&#8217;t travel across Star Fields in its current state. We just have to find a safe place to repair the spaceship, and we will be able to return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, I know a planet that can repair spaceships and is not controlled by any civilization,&#8221; Orozen said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very safe and is located at the edge of the Shattered Star Ring. We just have to fix our spaceship there, then we can leave this Star Field. I escaped from the Shattered Star Ring from there sixty years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing the name of that planet, Colin checked the star map and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. It&#8217;s very far from the Star Pupil Holy Race. We can use our speed to earn enough buffer time for us to repair the spaceships.&#8221;</p>
<p>They would only dare travel across Star Fields after they fixed their spaceships. Otherwise, if the spaceships malfunctioned in the middle of a desolate universe belt, they could be stuck there forever.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Light Fox&#8217; spaceships immediately changed direction, turned into a stream of light, and disappeared.</p>
<p>On Planet Avitan, the last EsGod doppelganger was destroyed, turning into a cluster of black fog and dissipated.</p>
<p>Psyker patted away the dust on his clothes and looked up at the sky with a grave expression.</p>
<p>The Evolution Cube has really been stolen. I didn&#8217;t expect EsGod to have the detailed information on the Evolution Cube. This was a miscalculation&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Three EsGod doppelgangers were equivalent to three Beyond Grade As. They were working together while he was alone, so EsGod succeeding was not completely illogical. Psyker felt resigned.</p>
<p>This was also why EsGod was very difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>However, Psyker was still calm and did not panic. He narrowed his eyes and murmured, &#8220;You did succeed, but don&#8217;t ever think you&#8217;ll take the Evolution Cube away from me this easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Psyker did not have the instruction manual of the Evolution Cube, after having the Evolution Cube for so long, he had gained some knowledge of it. Like how Austin owned the Palace of Hidden Spells, after Psyker had the Evolution Cube in his hands for so many years, he had almost made the Evolution Cube his own treasure.</p>
<p>He had built a spiritual connection with the Evolution Cube. Even if the Evolution Cube was not beside him, he could still remotely use the Evolution Cube to improve his psychic abilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, he had left a mark on the Evolution Cube. No matter where it was, he could sense the location of the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>He could sense the coordinates of the Evolution Cube moving extremely quickly, marking where Colin and the rest were.</p>
<p>Fleeing right after you stole from me?</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be so easy!</p>
<p>Psyker pressed a finger on his forehead and communicated with his subordinates through his psychic abilities. &#8220;Prepare the fastest spaceship for me. I&#8217;m going after those thieves!&#8221;</p>

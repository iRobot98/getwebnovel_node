				<h3>Chapter 728 Enchantment and Leaving Tutelage</h3>
<p>Despite a Psychic toxin sounding pretty severe, Han Xiao was not too flustered and only found it pretty troublesome. He had always believed that there would be more solutions than problems.</p>
<p>“Even you can’t clean up the toxin?” Han Xiao asked Lagi.</p>
<p>“I can engrave a soul defense rune formation on your body at the very most to slow down the speed at which the toxin invades your soul.” Lagi sighed. “However, these methods won’t be able to treat you. It was indeed a mistake for me to become a Mage.”</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>Feidin then interrupted him and said, “I can also help you strengthen your soul’s defense to defend against the Psychic toxin. As for purging it entirely, this is something that neither of us are unable to achieve. You have to think of another method.”</p>
<p>Feidin was the most talented individual in the army, and he had entered the Calamity Grade even before Sylvia. However, his status in the army was more like a guest, and he did not have any responsibilities.</p>
<p>“Then help me suppress the toxin for now. I will think of another way.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao felt slightly relieved. Things were fine as long as they were not totally helpless.</p>
<p>Despite a Beyond Grade A Psychic being extremely powerful, a Calamity Grade Super would also be able to defend against it to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Feidin’s body began glowing brightly, and an endless stream of psychic energy rushed out from his body like a tidal wave and enveloped Han Xiao’s mental world. A hexagonal structure then appeared on Han Xiao’s mental wall to strengthen its defense.</p>
<p>Very quickly, the effect of the Psychic toxin was obviously reduced, and the purplish fog also seemed to have become less aggressive.</p>
<p>Han Xiao instantly felt energized, and the feeling of weakness and disturbance was reduced greatly. (Poisoned Soul] only reduced fourteen percent of his attributes from the original twenty percent, and the effects of (Mild Hallucination) and (Sensory Misdirection) had also been reduced.</p>
<p>“I will have to inscribe the rune formation on your body. Let’s exit.” Lagi’s mental body then left the chatroom in Han Xiao’s mind.</p>
<p>Han Xiao and Feidin also retracted their mental bodies, and their senses returned to the outside world. Han Xiao felt the scene before his eyes changing, and he was back in the cultivation chamber of the spaceship. Feidin also retracted his finger and walked to the side.</p>
<p>Lagi walked forward, and with a flip of his palm, a small jade green crystal staff appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>Waving the staff, ten or so thick spell books appeared in front of him and began flipping themselves automatically. As the pages were flipped, pages full of magical incantations fell off automatically and hovered around Lagi. These were the formations that Lagi was preparing to inscribe on Han Xiao.</p>
<p>“Take off your top. I will inscribe a formation on your body.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao took off his top and revealed his muscular upper body. His muscles were packed tightly, and despite being packed full with power, they were extremely lean, not bulky like a Pugilist. The (Golden Ratio Body] talent that he had transformed his body into a work of art.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>“Go ahead.” Han Xiao nodded.</p>
<p>Lagi circulated his magic, and his eyes glowed brightly. With his staff as a brush and magic as paint, he began to draw a formation on Han Xiao’s body.</p>
<p>The cool magic energy lingered around his body with a tinge of pain and itchiness. It felt just like getting a tattoo.</p>
<p>After ten or so minutes, Lagi let out a long breath and spat out a mouthful of magic breath. At the same time, the glow in his eyes receded as well. For a mage of his caliber to spend a full ten or so minutes inscribing an enchantment, it could be said that he was giving it his all.</p>
<p>Lagi then took a few steps back and studied Han Xiao’s back as he said, “Although I don’t know if it will work… my drawing is truly nice.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao lowered his head to take a look. At this moment, his entire body was filled with exquisite and complicated runes that looked like tattoos.</p>
<p>A bluish-gold circular formation could be seen on the left of his chest, and a horoscope-like shape could be seen on his abdomen. The two formations were connected by a chain-like inscription that covered his entire arms as though they were wrapped up in chains. His back was also covered with runes, with his backbone as a tree trunk and countless branch-like formations extending out from his backbone.</p>
<p>Apart from his face, Han Xiao was covered in runes all over his body that flickered with a dim glow as though the runes were breathing.</p>
<p>“With your body as the foundation, I inscribed plenty of formations on your body through body enchantments. The formations will automatically absorb the elements that exist in nature to replenish themselves.”</p>
<p>Body enchantment was an important skill in the enchantment path. It could strengthen certain aspects of the target, and some magical civilizations would use this method to strengthen the combat capabilities of their soldiers. There were some powerhouses who would also inscribe enchantments on their own bodies. Han Xiao was not a stranger to these enchantments, and there were mages from his previous life who specialized in providing such enchantment services.</p>
<p>This was the way a mage could earn money, just like how a Mechanic sold their products.</p>
<p>Han Xiao stroked his arm curiously, and his finger could clearly feel the inscription lines of the rune. Even with his experience, he could clearly feel that the enchantment on his body was extremely complicated.</p>
<p>“The level of enchantment is limited by the strength of your body. The more enchantments, the greater the burden on your body. Thankfully, your body is extremely powerful, and I was able to inscribe plenty of enchantments.”</p>
<p>Lagi then said with assurance, “The protection of the Sacred Emperor, hug of the white robed mage ancestor, five different soul protection formations, the thirteen rings of secret soul stabilizing formation, and so on.”</p>
<p>“The effects are pretty good. I feel much more comfortable.”</p>
<p>The various hallucinations were being suppressed, and Han Xiao’s head was much clearer than before. Looking at the interface, the various negative statuses were weakened once again, and the negative effects of (Poisoned Soul] was reduced to a mere five percent.</p>
<p>On his interface, the effect of these various enchantments was displayed with the majority of them having the effect of increasing his Psychological Resistance. Because of an increase in the base attribute, the boost from his (Advanced Psychological Resistance) talent also increased.</p>
<p>“Right, I also inscribed a mental exploration formation for you.” Lagi pointed at a small formation on Han Xiao’s chest. “As long as you gather your attention on this formation, you will be able to enter your own mental world without our aid. You can use this ability to observe the situation of the Psychic toxin.”</p>
<p>“This is practical.” Han Xiao was overjoyed. A Mechanic did not have any mental abilities, and he was not able to observe his mental world on his own. He could not possibly get their help all the time. With this enchantment, he would be able to enter his own mental world anytime he wanted.</p>
<p>He tested the formation, and his mental body immediately entered his mental world.</p>
<p>At this moment, there were many barriers around the Psychic toxin, and the region of the toxin was reduced to six percent from the previous ten percent.</p>
<p>“These measures are only capable of suppressing the toxin, but if I want to purge it completely, I still need the help of a Beyond Grade A Super…”</p>
<p>There was no need to mention Psyker. Han Xiao did not even know if Psyker was an enemy or neutral party. Furthermore, he did not have any relationship with Psyker, and Han Xiao was not prepared to find him. It would be much more convenient for him to find Austin instead. While Austin was a mage, there were similarities between the Mage class and the Psychic class.</p>
<p>Han Xiao then left his mental world and took out his communicator. After thinking for a while, he put on his clothes and contacted Austin.</p>
<p>“Black Star?” The child-like Austin appeared in the holographic projection. “It has been a few years since you last contacted me. Why are you looking for me?”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency Magus, I hope to receive your help…”</p>
<p>Han Xiao explained what had happened.</p>
<p>“You were actually struck by Psyker’s Psychic attack? You are truly unlucky.” Austin laughed. “Alright, come and find me. I haven’t seen Psyker for a long time. Let me see if he has improved.”</p>
<p>Among the four Beyond Grade A Supers in the Shattered Star Ring, Heber was tyrannical, Ames was willful, Psyker was arrogant, and only Austin was friendly. Upon hearing that Han Xiao needed his help, he agreed without much hesitation.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief before turning to look at Lagi. “Do you want to follow me to Austin’s territory?”</p>
<p>Lagi shook his head. Since he had left, he was not planning to return.</p>
<p>“Alright then. You can remain in the Black Star Army and work together with Herlous and Sylvia to tie up any loose ends after the battle. I will be leaving for a short while,” Han Xiao said solemnly. “Only you two know of my condition in the army. Don’t let anyone know.”</p>
<p>Even Jorde did not know the exact effect of the toxin, and Han Xiao was prepared to seal all news about it. He did not want to expose his temporary weakness.</p>
<p>“Feidin, follow me for now,” Han Xiao said.</p>
<p>With Feidin beside him, he would be able to enjoy Feidin’s Luck Glow, and the moment any changes happened to the toxin, Feidin would be able to help him to a certain extent. Most importantly, his energy would become fertilizer for the toxin if he went into battle, and he needed to keep some fighters beside him. Feidin was currently a Grade A Psychic, and his combat capability was reliable.</p>
<p>“I will naturally be beside you since you are in trouble.” Feidin smiled warmly, and his entire face seemed to be radiating light.</p>
<p>My goodness, please don’t unleash your charisma already… Han Xiao felt his head ache.</p>
<p>After the battle was over, Section Zero left some forces to guard the borders of the Kant Star System and build up a defensive line to prevent the Bloodshed Land from making a comeback.</p>
<p>The one million players who joined the battle returned full of rewards. Meanwhile, Han Xiao took Feidin and another bodyguard, Marian, and left the main force for Hidden Red Robe Abbey.</p>
<p>Han Xiao would be able to give out missions from the faction interface even from afar. All his products were already placed in the faction store, and Han Xiao did not need to follow beside the players all the time.</p>
<p>The players returned with their bags full of rewards this time, and with the fifty-percent discount still active in the faction store, Han Xiao was not afraid that no one would shop in the faction store. Thus, there was no need for Han Xiao to worry about that for now. Furthermore, after this battle, there would not be another large-scale battle like this in the near future. He had more than enough free time to take care of the psychic toxin.</p>
<p>The Hidden Red Robe Abbey was located in a different Star Cluster, and the journey would take a long time.</p>
<p>At the same time, on Planet Heber, the command team calculated the losses from the battle, and Jorde listened to the reports from his subordinates. Despite the losses being significant, Jorde still had a smile on his face and was not frustrated in the least.</p>
<p>Since Section Zero had sent all their forces, it was only normal for them to be chased out. However, their greatest harvest from this battle was succeeding in their sneak attack on Black Star. Jorde was extremely satisfied about this.</p>
<p>Black Star was only a single individual but could single handedly suppress all the high-level combatants on their side. Over the past ten years, Bloodshed Land had lost more than a hundred Calamity Grade Supers by Black Star’s hands. Even if they had the talents of an entire Star Cluster backing them, this was not a small amount.</p>
<p>Heber’s heart was as hard as steel, and he did not care about the losses that his forces had suffered. However, Jorde could not remain indifferent. He was an extremely meticulous butler and felt his heart ache over the loss of high-level combatants. If not for Heber wanting to rear a pig, Jorde definitely would not have allowed Han Xiao to do as he wished in the battlefield for so long.</p>
<p>He had made use of so many different methods but still failed to kill Black Star. Even if Black Star fell for his trap, Jorde felt as though he still could not threaten Black Star’s life. Thus, Jorde was not prepared to send out more assassins but chose to leave Black Star to His Excellency Tyrant instead.</p>
<p>Jorde was in an extremely good mood that day. He was extremely satisfied with the outcome of weakening Black Star.</p>
<p>Although he did not know what kind of injury Black Star had suffered, Jorde prayed for the best outcome, that Black Star would not be able to participate in the war anymore.</p>
<p>Without Black Star, the high-level combatants of their Bloodshed Land could go all out.</p>
<p>In some Star System within the Colton Star Cluster, Floating Dragon Island was drifting in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Compared to seven years prior, Floating Dragon Island had experienced a huge change. There were now three floating islands, one large and two small.</p>
<p>The largest island was the original floating island, which was now the main island. The other two smaller islands revolved around the main island like two small satellites. These were two new subsidiary islands where the Floating Dragon armed forces were located.</p>
<p>With the support of the Black Star Army, Vilna had only taken seven years to grow Floating Dragon’s second field team to a pretty sizable scale. Even the port of the main island was not able to fit the entire armed force. As such, both subsidiary islands were army camps for the new armed force. The two islands had been created by Ames’ force field.</p>
<p>Seven years of development had given Floating Dragon a new look.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ames, Aesop, Vilna, and Jenny were gathered at the Floating Dragon dock. All the famous individuals on Floating Dragon Island were present.</p>
<p>A small reddish spaceship was parked at the dock, and both Hila and Aurora were carrying on to their suitcases.</p>
<p>Both of their personalities remained the same, but they were much more mature than seven years prior. They were dressed in Battle Suits of different designs and colors. Hila’s outfit was red and black in color while Aurora’s outfit was white with golden rims.</p>
<p>“Are you really not going to consider staying behind to help me?” Vilna asked with a look of regret.</p>
<p>The date for the Black Star Army’s departure grew nearer and nearer, and Vilna’s second armed force was one that belonged solely to Floating Dragon. She was the commander of the fleet with plenty of elites and experts under her.</p>
<p>She had been working for Floating Dragon for a full seven years and had a close relationship with the officers of Floating Dragon. She was especially close to both Aurora and Hila.</p>
<p>It was the day for Hila and Aurora to leave Floating Dragon. They had followed the Dragon Emperor for more than ten years, and it was time for them to leave their teacher’s tutelage.</p>
<p>Vilna had pleaded for the sisters to stay behind on more than one occasion to become her leftand right-hand officers. However, it was a pity that the two were determined to leave.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Sister Vilna. We promised Uncle Black Star that we would go and find him.” Aurora had an apologetic look on her face.</p>
<p>Vilna let out a sigh. The Black Star Army had helped her out a lot, and the sisters had a close relationship with Black Star. She would also be embarrassed to poach them from Black Star.</p>
<p>Jenny then said coldly, “I have deposited 200,000 Enas into your accounts, which will be sufficient for your journey. Black Star is a wealthy individual, and there won’t be a need for me to give you any more money after you join him.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sister Jenny,” Aurora said politely.</p>
<p>“Humph.” Jenny turned around without saying anything else. She was extremely depressed that both of them were so insistent on joining the Black Star Army.</p>
<p>Wilsander then chuckled and said, “Remember to say hello to Black Star for me when you see him.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Aurora nodded.</p>
<p>“Right, help me say hi, too.” The Logistics Manager Haier, who was used to being a transparent bug, also spoke up.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Aurora shrank back slightly. Even after knowing each other for more than ten years, Haier’s ferocious appearance still scared her slightly.</p>
<p>Aesop then shook his head and said, “I looked into both of your futures, and I don’t know if it is a good or bad thing for both of you to follow Black Star.”</p>
<p>Aurora blinked and said, “Destiny is never fixed and will change anytime. This is something that you have told us.”</p>
<p>Aesop let out a long sigh while muttering words like ‘Black Star’, ‘death’, and ‘war’ under his breath.</p>
<p>Finally, both of their gazes landed on Ames.</p>
<p>Ames smiled and said softly, “Be careful.”</p>
<p>Aurora smiled sweetly and replied, “Okay, Teacher.”</p>
<p>Even the emotionless Hila revealed a look of respect and gave a deep bow. “Thank you for your teachings over the past ten years.”</p>
<p>A doting look could be seen in Ames’ eyes, and she nodded without saying anything else.</p>
<p>Hila then straightened her back and looked at her comrades and friends over the past ten years. She then pulled Aurora along with her and boarded the dark red spaceship.</p>
<p>The spaceship then floated up into the air and disappeared into the stars under the gazes of Ames and the others.</p>
<p>Ames placed her arms behind her back and softly muttered, “So, this is the feeling of being a teacher.”</p>
<p>Aesop’s ear twitched slightly, and he tiptoed away like a thief.</p>

				<h3>Chapter 1417 The Behind-the-Scenes and the Truth</h3>
<p>Since his Luck Glow guinea pigs were not around at the moment, it was not a good time to complete the mission. Han Xiao closed the interface and looked at Oathkeeper and Clotti.</p>
<p>“Do you not have anything to do? Is the war over? Did the enemy retreat?”</p>
<p>“No…” Oathkeeper and Clotti regained their senses and shook their heads.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>“Then what are you guys doing here? Aren’t you going to deal with the enemy?”</p>
<p>“I’ll go now.”</p>
<p>Oathkeeper immediately stepped into the spatial rift, searching for a shallow dimension battlefield to join.</p>
<p>Clotti looked at Han Xiao deeply before disappearing The three Universal Civilizations did not monitor the battle between the two Transcendent Grade Supers in the spatial storm, but he remembered everything. Be it Black Star’s terrifying combat strength or the fact that the World Tree had a Transcendent Grade trump card, he had to report this important information to the upper echelons.</p>
<p>Han Xiao did not retract his troops, only shrinking the body size of his Supreme Celestial Venerable. He tore open a spatial rift that led to a battlefield, before controlling the Mechanical Deity to walk in.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The battleships that filled the sky were shooting and killing each other. Their formations were interconnected, and the battle was intense. The three Universal Civilizations were in a dire situation, and they were being surrounded and destroyed.</p>
<div class="smuaj60de77a89a7d5"></div>
<p>When the World Tree Blessed Race saw a Mechanical Deity covered in black clouds descend, they immediately changed the direction of their attacks and fired at it.</p>
<p>The Supreme Heavenly Venerate however did not move at all. The mechanical soldiers that formed a black cloud beside him immediately split up and blocked in front of him. At the same time, they activated their shields, forming a gigantic psionic shield that protected the entire Supreme Heavenly Venerate. All of the fleet’s firepower was blocked and the surface of the shield was covered in bright lights and ripples.</p>
<p>Han Xiao raised the Emperor Skysplitter Blade and pointed it at this large World Tree fleet that covered the entire sky. He twisted his arm slightly and spun the blade in a semicircle. The next moment, an invisible psionic wave spread out from the tip of the sword and quickly engulfed most of the fleet.</p>
<p>The next moment, countless battleships exploded at the same time. Their shields shattered and disappeared, all of them malfunctioning and falling in different directions.</p>
<p>Wherever the psionic waves passed, battleships fell like raindrops!</p>
<p>As he was now, Han Xiao no longer needed to use the Human Wave Tactic to deal with a large number of troops. The Psionic Wave was a killing machine for group battles, and it was finally used on the official battlefield. The number of fleets was almost meaningless in front of this technology.</p>
<p>“This black technology is more useful than I expected. It was not in vain that I strengthened you into a Divine Artifact.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Looking at the spectacular sight of the spaceships falling from the sky, Han Xiao could not help but feel happy.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>This time, he had revealed his strength to seal the Secret Tree King. There was no need for him to continue hiding, so he naturally chose to join the battle.</p>
<p>“Lord, there are too many battlefields. Do you need us to attack?”</p>
<p>Psionic Prime asked respectfully as he stood on the shoulder of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate with the rest of the Mechanical Oracles. “Bring your children to help.” Han Xiao nodded.</p>
<p>As soon as he said that, the dozens of Mechanical Oracles immediately took action. They each brought a group of mechanical troops and headed to different shallow dimension battlefields to support the three Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>With the support of Han Xiao’s Mechanical Force, the combat power of the mechanical army was extraordinary. With a huge leap, the mechanical army entered the battlefield one after another, giving the various World Tree Blessed Race members a huge blow.</p>
<p>Han Xiao, on the other hand, controlled the Supreme Heavenly Venerate to move alone. The huge Mechanical Lifeform strolled through the battlefields one after another, waving the enormous double-bladed sword, the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, and constantly activating its AOE. Psionic waves slashed out like light blades, sweeping through the World Tree fleets.</p>
<p>After fighting for an unknown period of time, Han Xiao could not remember how many of the World Tree Blessed Race he had wiped out. Suddenly, the World Tree fleet stopped firing at the same time in the various shallow dimensions.</p>
<p>Their blitzkrieg had started with great momentum, and they wanted to end the battle quickly. However, they had now kicked on an iron plate. Seeing that the situation was not going to work, the Blessed Race finally gave up on this invasion and chose to retreat.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“We finally repelled the World Tree.”</p>
<p>In the meeting room of the leader of the main universe, the three Universal Civilizations’ leaders looked at the scene of the World Tree Army retreating and finally relaxed. “It was not easy for the World Tree to find an opportunity to open up the second frontline. They will not give up so easily. After resting for some time, they might make a comeback.” Louis pondered.</p>
<p>The Pope nodded and added with a worried tone, “The opening of the second battlefront is extremely disadvantageous for us. The secondary dimension battlefield is a meat grinder that is even more terrifying than the main universe’s border. The main purpose of this battle is to fight head-on, and the losses will not be low. While their fleet can be constantly renewed, our losses are real. Although the Underworld can store the souls of most of the fallen warriors, Aurora’s current energy level cannot take care of all the losses of our soldiers in the interstellar battlefield…”</p>
<p>Marbruce clasped his hands together and suddenly said, “It’s not a big problem. The enemy has an army, and we have Black Star.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the other two had complicated expressions. After receiving Clotti’s report, they finally knew the true strength of a Transcendent. They had already tried their best to raise their expectations, but they had still underestimated Han Xiao’s strength.</p>
<p>“Sigh, the combat power of a Transcendent is truly astonishing. However, I didn’t expect the World Tree to also have another Transcendent,” the Pope said with surprise.</p>
<p>“Luckily, Black Star has stepped into the same grade. Otherwise, no one on our side would be able to counter the World Tree’s trump card. We would definitely suffer heavy casualties…”</p>
<p>The three of them had mixed feelings and some lingering fear.</p>
<p>The Transcendent Grade Black Star made them extremely afraid, but he also gave them a sense of security. If Black Star did not break through this limit, the galactic society would be at an absolute disadvantage in terms of individual strength. Once the Tree God descended, they would be easily defeated.</p>
<p>The current situation was barely stable, and at least half of it was due to Black Star’s efforts. The contribution he had made was greater than all three of them combined. “However, after this battle, the World Tree should have been frightened by Black Star. The next time it wishes to attack the shallow dimensions, it will probably think twice before making such plans.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>The three of them nodded and heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>World Tree Territory, Tree King Palace.</p>
<p>Green lights gathered on the throne and condensed into the bodies of the Ancestral Tree King and the Fortitude Tree King. Both of them had ugly expressions, not only because the Secret Tree King was sealed, but also because of the consequences of the Tree God’s advent.</p>

</div>
<p>“The Secret Tree King is also gone… I didn’t expect the Mechanic, who was still a peak Beyond Grade A ten years ago, to have stepped into the Transcendent Grade.”</p>
<p>The Ancestral Tree King rubbed his forehead, trying to alleviate the pain in his soul. He spoke with a hoarse voice that was filled with shock and anger.</p>
<p>The moment Black Star revealed his true strength and instantly captured the Secret Tree King, he was shocked. Knowing that the Secret Tree King probably could not be saved, he decisively gave up on the Secret Tree King and activated the Tree God’s Advent without hesitation.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Tree God was like mixing the bodies and souls of the five Tree Kings together. It was extremely painful, as it forcibly formed a new consciousness between them, fusing with the will of the mother tree. The aftereffects were very severe. After disintegrating, the Tree Kings would have cognitive disorders from time to time, and their minds would be in a mess for a long time before recovering.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that he had no other choice, the Ancestral Tree King would not have wanted to use it. It was not because he wanted to compete with Black Star, but because he was worried that if he did not summon the Tree God, he would not be able to escape from Black Star’s hands, inevitably following in the footsteps of the Secret Tree King.</p>
<div></div>
<p>In addition, every time the Tree God descended, it would severely deplete the power of the Tree King Crown, causing the powers of each Tree King to decrease. It would take time for the Crown to recover. The time taken for the Tree King Crown to return to its peak was also the cooldown period for the Tree God’s Advent. If the Tree Kings used the Tree God’s Advent consecutively, the Tree King Crowns would shatter and disappear after three times. It would take thousands of years for it to be reborn, which meant that the Tree Kings would no longer have any special bonuses during this time. It would be a mere title.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the descent of the Tree God required a special fuel. It was a material called the ‘Legacy of the King’. When a Tree King failed to advance to the Transcendent Grade and died, this special material would be produced. The mother tree could not convert this and could only store it. Although it had accumulated over the years, the number of Tree Kings who chose to advance in recent times was decreasing. Each ‘Legacy of the King’ used would mean one less… and only the Ancestral Tree King knew about this!</p>
<p>As the most experienced tree king, the Ancestral Tree King also knew another secret</p>
<p>-any member of the World Tree would die if they chose to advance to the Transcendent Grade. This had nothing to do with their talent but was rather a restriction of the mother tree.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the mother tree was not as strong as it was now. Instead, through the feedback provided by its civilization, it had devoured countless things to grow to its current state.</p>
<p>Only by devouring something new and possessing the information state of that thing would the World Tree be able to unlock the corresponding abilities. The World Tree had never devoured a Transcendent Grade Super before, so Beyond Grade As were the individual limits of the World Tree Supers. However, this did not mean that the members of the World Tree would not be able to advance. In fact, as long as a Tree King could step into the Transcendent Grade, they would be able to take back their information state that had been devoured by the mother tree. They would then be separated from the World Tree and gain their freedom.</p>
<p>However, the World Tree would not allow any member to escape its control. So long as someone tried to advance, not only would the mother tree not protect them, but it would also automatically interfere. This was because everyone’s Information Form was under its control, thus it could easily trigger a vicious mutation during their promotion. Therefore, in terms of strength, one would never reach the Transcendent Grade. All the Tree Kings that had tried to advance had died and turned into the ‘Legacy of the King’, which was the Beyonder’s Vestige, stored in the World Tree.</p>
<p>Therefore, the will of the Mother Tree had such a strong appetite after it descended as the Tree God Advent, and it could not wait to eat Black Star… So long as it devoured this true Transcendent Grade life form, it would be able to obtain the information form of the Transcendent Grade and unlock the upper limit of individual strength. Of course, there would be a price to be paid for the ability to revive indefinitely. Their upper limit was shackled, and only when the World Tree grew would their upper limit be increased… However, no one except the Ancestral Tree King knew about this.</p>
<p>The Ancestral Tree King never chose to advance because he did not want to benefit others. Furthermore, he kept this secret and did not tell the subsequent Tree Kings.</p>
<p>All sorts of thoughts flashed through his mind, and the Ancestral Tree King said with a deep voice,</p>
<p>“The timing of that Mechanic’s advancement is too coincidental. Our luck is not on our side. Luckily, I took back the crown of the Secret Tree King at the crucial moment. Otherwise, the power of the Tree God would have dropped even further.”</p>
<p>“The Secret Tree King can’t be saved now. Who are you planning to let inherit this title?”</p>
<p>The Fortitude Tree King clenched his teeth as he held his head in pain and asked.</p>
<p>“…Let’s think about it again.” The Ancestral Tree King’s expression was grave as he looked at the three empty thrones. His mood was extremely bad.</p>
<p>Of the five Great Tree Kings, one had died, two had been sealed, and only two were left. When had they ever been in such a sorry state during their battles in the universe?!</p>
<p>This was a truly miserable outcome…</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person who stayed behind to accompany him was the most annoying salted fish, the Fortitude Tree King. This caused the Ancestral Tree King to only feel more tired.</p>
<p>The one he wanted to eliminate the most was the Fortitude Tree King. It was not only because this guy liked to slack off, but also because he suspected that he might have guessed something. That was why he was so lazy and did not bother to advance anymore.</p>
<p>The Fortitude Tree King however did not notice the look in the Ancestral Tree King’s eyes and said worriedly, “The Tree God’s Advent is incomplete, and we are no match for that Mechanic. Our individual strengths are also completely suppressed. What should we do in the future?”</p>
<p>“We can only temporarily give up on the battle of individual strength. Don’t let the high-level combatants make a move, or we’ll be sealed one by one. Furthermore, we probably won’t be able to save the Heart Tree King. That Tree King Crown might be lost forever…”</p>
<p>The Ancestral Tree King was depressed.</p>
<p>“What about the mother tree’s natural enemy?” the Fortitude Tree King asked with a worried tone.</p>
<p>“…That is another time bomb. I have to think of something.”</p>
<div class="ctahe60de77a89a7aa"></div>
<p>The Ancestral Tree King’s expression darkened.</p>
<p>The World Tree was originally very calm about this war. It was in no hurry and was fearless like a fisherman.</p>
<p>However, the appearance of the Pivotal Snake had hit their weak spot, causing their advantageous situation to become precarious. They had no choice but to race against time, causing themselves to fall into a quagmire! If it was just the coordinates of the mother tree’s main body being exposed, the Ancestral Tree King would not panic. He had always emphasized that the main body could not be moved, but the main body of the mother tree was not fixed. Although the moving process was troublesome, it could indeed be transplanted into other secondary dimensions.</p>
<p>The reason he had revealed the fake information was to leave himself a way out. He was akin to a crafty rabbit with three burrows, and he could also use that as a trap… However, no civilization had forced him to reveal this trump card, so the Ancestral Tree King had kept it a secret until now.</p>
<p>However, a Pivotal Snake in its adulthood could sense the location of the mother tree’s main body at any time. It was equivalent to a radar that could locate the mother tree from an infinite distance. No matter how many times the main body was transplanted, it would be useless. This was a huge matter regarding the survival of the civilization, and the Ancestral Tree King had to take it seriously! However, even if the World Tree could sense its natural enemy, the Pivot Snake was protected by the Mechanic, and they had almost no chance at all. This was the biggest threat!</p>
<div class="ujxyv60de77a89a7fb"></div>
<p>After thinking about it, he was still at a loss as to what he could do.</p>
<p>The only way he could think of now was to destroy the three Universal Civilizations without caring about the casualties. This way, even if Black Star had the Pivotal Snake, it would be difficult for him to gather enough strength to attack the mother tree.</p>
<p>“Even so, it will only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. That Mechanic will forever be a threat to the mother tree…</p>
<p>If there are no new variables, I’m afraid…”</p>
<p>The Ancestral Tree King clenched his fists. A layer of haze covered his heart, and his expression wavered.</p>

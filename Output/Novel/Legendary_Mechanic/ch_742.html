				<h3>Chapter 742 One Cannon Is Enough</h3>
<p>After getting rid of the first altar, they spent a night outside before returning to the gathering point in Stone Heart City.</p>
<p>After finding out about the successful mission, Lanley was extremely surprised.</p>
<p>“All of you succeeded so quickly?”</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>He has been leading the gathering point in Stone Heart City for many years already and had always been wary of the demonic spirit army near the altar. Due to the lack of manpower, he did not dare act too rashly. He had originally thought that Han Xiao and his group would need eight to ten days to slowly clear up the demonic spirits near the altar. However, Han Xiao’s efficiency had truly surprised him.</p>
<p>That was especially so after realizing that there were no injuries in the group, and only Tomar looked as though he did not have a good sleep. Lanley was extremely curious about the details of their operation.</p>
<p>“I remember that there should be a few hundred demonic spirits. How did all of you accomplish this?”</p>
<p>“It’s like this…” Tomar swallowed a mouthful of saliva and began to explain.</p>
<p>When they set up camp outside last night, Feidin had given Tomar a subtle mental hint together with the ‘divine miracles’ that Han Xiao had gotten Aurora to perform. Tomar had completely believed that Han Xiao’s group of four were deities.</p>
<p>He was the only one who knew the truth about the ‘deities’, and Tomar was agitated to the point he could not sleep. In order to hide the identity of the ‘deities’, he had spent a full night thinking of an appropriate excuse to report to Lanley today.</p>
<p>As he gave his ‘explanation’, Tomar was extremely anxious that Lanley would spot a flaw.</p>
<p>He did not understand why the ‘deities’ wanted to hide their identities, but he did not dare gamble. He was afraid that the ‘deities’ would choose to leave if their identities were exposed. This would result in the gathering point losing such great support.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the broken fragments of the altar, Lanley did not have any other doubts, and after expressing his gratitude to Han Xiao, he left hastily to contact the leaders of the other gathering points.</p>
<p>“I managed to hide it…” Tomar heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Good job.” Han Xiao nodded.</p>
<p>Tomar was extremely reserved in front of Han Xiao. Although Han Xiao’s group of four seemed extremely approachable and were not aloof like in the religious records, Tomar still felt immense pressure. He then said, “Your Excellencies, I have a question that I don’t know if I should ask.”</p>
<p>“Speak.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I have been curious since last night…” Tomar stammered. “The deities in the religious records all have their own names and authority. I wonder if… cough cough, I don’t know if it is rude for me to ask this. If it is, I hope that you can accept my apology…”</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>In truth, he wanted to ask if Han Xiao’s group of four were the deities in the legends that he had heard.</p>
<p>“Names…” Han Xiao stroked his chin before saying with a smile, “This isn’t a secret. My divine name is Black Star.”</p>
<p>Black Star?</p>
<p>Tomar had a look of confusion. He had never heard of such a deity in all the stories he heard.</p>
<p>Han Xiao then pointed at Hila and Aurora. “They are the deities of death and life.”</p>
<p>Hila had a speechless look on her face and could only allow Han Xiao to joke as he wished.</p>
<p>“As for him…” Han Xiao turned around and looked at Feidin who had an expectant look on his face. After letting out a light cough, he joked, “He is the deity of luck. Let me remind you about something, he is both male and female in one body and doesn’t have a gender.”</p>
<p>Must you really emphasize my gender… Feidin had a look of resignation on his face.</p>
<p>Tomar engraved the names into his heart and immediately expressed his loyalty. “I will spread all of your names and allow the world to know who the real deities are. I will spread your glory in this land.”</p>
<p>“We can talk about this in the future.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao tried his best to stifle his laughter. When Tomar entered the universe, this would definitely be his dark past.</p>
<p>After completing the second phase of the mission and gaining the trust of the gathering point, the gathering point began to treat the four ‘great wizards’ with much importance. In the following days, the gathering point gave many tasks to the four of them as part of the mission.</p>
<p>With his overwhelming strength and galactic technology, Han Xiao completed the missions with incredible efficiency. Some of the missions included destroying the other two altars, clearing up demonic spirits in many different cities, killing some of Vosumede’s henchmen, collecting rare materials, and so on.</p>
<p>The use of a spaceship greatly reduced their travelling time, and Han Xiao was able to easily find the rare materials by scanning the entire continent with his devices. He only needed half a month to solve the problem that had been troubling the gathering point for fifty years.</p>
<p>The entire gathering point was shocked by Han Xiao’s divine efficiency, which was almost like a miracle. Tomar bitterly tried to hide the ‘truth’ and did not expose the identities of the ‘deities’.</p>
<p>However, the result of Han Xiao’s efficiency was the suspicion of the upper echelons in the gathering point. There were some who felt that the four of them were far too successful and might be spies sent by Vosumede. Vosumede might intend to lure them all out to catch them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Wulis was the current leader of all the gathering points, and he was the one who suspected Han Xiao’s group of four the most. However, he did not reveal his suspicion, instead keeping some secrets from the four.</p>
<p>His plan was to create a ‘divine weapon’ to fight with Vosumede, and the rare materials that Han Xiao had gathered were the materials for the ‘divine weapon*. However, he did not reveal anything to Han Xiao’s group of four.</p>
<p>This way, even if Han Xiao’s group of four were spies for Vosumede, they would not know his true plan. At the same time, he would be able to borrow their strength to gather the materials for the ‘divine weapon’.</p>
<p>In some secret location, all the gathered materials were sent over. Wulis and a few other wizards of the upper echelons were crafting this ‘divine weapon’ secretly.</p>
<p>The flames of the furnace lit up the dark room, and the ‘divine weapon* was beginning to take shape.</p>
<p>Clank!</p>
<p>As the iron hammer came into contact with the red-hot ores, sparks flew in all directions, and the ores gradually began to change shape.</p>
<p>Wulis and the others released their magical elixirs by the side, chanted incantations, and engraved formations to complete the process.</p>
<p>The last step was soon reached, and the blacksmith quenched the completed ‘divine weapon’ in ice-cold water. Whoosh!</p>
<p>A large amount of water was immediately evaporated, and after a long wait, the blacksmith removed a metallic staff from the cold water. It looked like black vines with many curses being engraved on it.</p>
<p>“It is finally completed! The White Sorcerer Wand!”</p>
<p>Wulis picked up the staff excitedly. This was the ‘divine weapon’ that their gathering point had always wanted to forge. It was able to greatly increase the strength of their magical powers and restrict the demonic spirit army. This was the nemesis of Vosumede’s Demonic Spirit Necklace.</p>
<p>All the wizards present had looks of joy on their faces.</p>
<p>“With the White Sorcerer Wand in our hands, we have the strength to face Vosumede head on!”</p>
<p>Wulis held on to the staff tightly and spoke in a bright voice.</p>
<p>“Everyone, we must keep the existence of this staff a secret. We must not let Vosumede and the four wizards of dubious origin know about it.</p>
<p>“This is our strongest trump card, and we will have to rely on it to kill Vosumede! It has been a full fifty years, and it is time for the final battle!</p>
<p>“Inform the wizards in all the gathering points. It is time to launch an all-out attack!”</p>
<p>Wulis burnt with battle intent.</p>
<p>The Chain Mission was at its second last phase, and its mission requirement was to head to the capital of the Ocean Boundary Kingdom to meet up with the wizards of the other gathering points. The next phase of the mission would be to defeat the final boss, Vosumede, in the palace of the Ocean Boundary Kingdom.</p>
<p>In some secret courtyard, all the wizards of the gathering points were gathered with Wulis as the leader. There were about 230 wizards present.</p>
<p>It was evening, and Wulis was giving a speech in front of the others.</p>
<p>“Tonight is the final battle, and we are going to sneak past the defense line of the palace to ambush the Great Palace Wizard. We will gather the strength of our gathering points to kill him. This is the moment when Vosumede is the weakest, and all of our success is thanks to our four new reclusive wizards.”</p>
<p>Wulis then nodded toward Han Xiao’s group of four, who were seated at the front, with a look of caution hidden in his eyes.</p>
<p>The way he saw it, if the four of them were spies, they would definitely expose themselves that night.</p>
<p>Wulis had already made preparations and got his trusted aids to keep an eye on the four of them.</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled without replying.</p>
<p>The mission would be at its final phase during the battle, and he would be able to reap the harvest from his half a month of hard work.</p>
<p>Tomar was within the crowd, and his fists were clenched with agitation.</p>
<p>I am the only one here who knows that they are deities…</p>
<p>Night descended after a long wait, and darkness enveloped the entire city.</p>
<p>Wulis no longer hesitated and announced the start of the mission.</p>
<p>Their large gang of more than two hundred wizards then approached the palace and suppressed their auras with magical powder. They snuck into the palace and did not disturb the guards.</p>
<p>Han Xiao’s group of four hid among the group and waited for the mission to enter the final phase.</p>
<p>The journey was extremely smooth, and the wizards very quickly gathered outside the palace of the Great Palace Wizard.</p>
<p>Wu!</p>
<p>Right at this moment, a military horn sounded from within the palace.</p>
<p>The palace doors swung open, and a few dozen wizards charged out from the palace. At the front of the group, an old man stood. He was Vosumede.</p>
<p>“Humph, a bunch of sneaky rats. I have been waiting for all of you for a long time,” Vosumede said proudly. “I have long found out about all of your little schemes over the past half a month and couldn’t be bothered with all of you. Do all of you really think that I was unaware of you sneaking into the capital?</p>
<p>“I have already been operating in the Ocean Boundary Kingdom for fifty years, and my demonic spirit army is hidden all around. I found out the moment you stepped into this city!</p>
<p>“The guards of the palace have already cut off your escape route and are on the way here. It will be impossible for you to escape!”</p>
<p>The moment these words were said, the wizards of the gathering point became jittery.</p>
<p>Wulis stood out from the crowd and said with a deep voice, “Don’t be anxious. The number of wizards in the palace is less than a quarter of ours. We will be able to kill them all before the guards arrive!”</p>
<p>Vosumede suddenly burst out into laughter. “Wulis, is your brain rotten? Have you forgotten about my strongest trump card?”</p>
<p>Vosumede grabbed the necklace on his neck as he said that, and the temperature in the surroundings fell immediately. A cold gust of wind blew over, and more than a thousand demonic spirits appeared.</p>
<p>A gigantic demonic spirit appeared beside Vosumede; it was the Demonic Spirit King.</p>
<p>The two hundred or so wizards of the gathering points took a step back subconsciously and looked at the demonic spirit army nervously.</p>
<p>This was what Vosumede had relied on to rule the wizard world for fifty years. His Demonic Spirit Necklace was able to create and control demonic spirits.</p>
<p>Compared to the anxiousness of the others, Wulis was extremely confident. He held onto the White Sorcerer Wand in his hands. This was the nemesis of the demonic spirit army and also the reason he had dared to challenge Vosumede.</p>
<p>You have a divine weapon, but I do too… Wulis sneered coldly in his heart.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, Wulis suddenly thought about Han Xiao’s group of four. His eyes narrowed, and he decided against using the White Sorcerer Wand.</p>
<p>The divine weapon had to be used at the most appropriate moment. Wulis was extremely wary of Han Xiao’s group of four, and he glanced at them carefully before making a decision.</p>
<p>If four of them are Vosumede’s accomplices and make any moves, I can use the White Sorcerer Wand to kill them!</p>
<p>On the other side, Vosumede stroked his beard and looked extremely calm as though the entire situation was within his grasp.</p>
<p>“Do you know, I have never concerned myself with you? If all of you chose to hide properly, I may have been willing to give you a path of survival. However, you chose to come out and create trouble for me time and time again, even wanting to kill me.</p>
<p>“Ah, your imaginations are as distant as the stars in the skies, and all of you are like a bunch of annoying flies.</p>
<p>“You hid yourselves for fifty years like rats. Do you think that it is possible to overthrow me? How ridiculous!”</p>
<p>As he said that, the luxurious robe on Vosumede’s body began fluttering despite the lack of wind. His powerful magical force burst forth from his body. In the eyes of Wulis and the other wizards of the gathering points, Vosumede’s aura seemed to have become like a towering building, suppressing their very souls.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Wulis and the others were shocked, and their faces turned pale.</p>
<p>“Humph! There is an even more powerful level above the great wizard realm. I made use of fifty years to take this last step…”</p>
<p>Vosumede stretched out his arms and let out arrogant laughter.</p>
<p>“I am now a god!”</p>
<p>The two hundred or so wizards were all dumbfounded, and even Wulis felt his heart falling into despair.</p>
<p>No! The situation has changed, and I cannot save my trump card to deal with a spy that may not even exist.</p>
<p>I must make use of the White Sorcerer Wand to severely wound Vosumede if not the others will die!</p>
<p>Wulis held onto the White Sorcerer Wand tightly and began chanting a series of mnemonics, ready to activate the ‘divine weapon’.</p>
<p>Vosumede obviously did not understand the logic of a bad guy dying because he talked too much. He was still intoxicated with the feeling of the entire situation being in his grasp. He raised his hand and pointed at the crowd as though he was looking down on a bunch of ants.</p>
<p>“You do not understand anything about true strength!”</p>
<p>As those words sounded, Wulis completed his preparations, and his eyes narrowed. He was about to use the White Sorcerer Wand to launch his strongest attack on Vosumede.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, a psionic cannon shot out from within the crowd and smashed onto Vosumede’s arrogant face before anyone could even react.</p>
<p>The speed of the attack was one that did not even allow him to dodge.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The flash of light came and went quickly, and Vosumede’s head disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>His headless body then shook for a while before collapsing on the ground.</p>
<p>Everyone present was stunned silly.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Vosumede’s headless body, and they could not believe what had happened.</p>
<p>Wait, Vosumede was… dead?</p>
<p>He died like that?</p>
<p>Wulis’ eyes bulged out to the point that they almost fell out.</p>
<p>Was I the one who killed him?</p>
<p>That’s not right… I didn’t even use the divine weapon…</p>
<p>Everyone then thought about the direction from which the ball of light was shot out from. They turned their heads and looked at Han Xiao’s group of four. The wizards of the gathering point then inched away from the four subconsciously.</p>
<p>“Mission complete.” Han Xiao then lowered his palm and opened his interface with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, the mission had entered the final phase, and Han Xiao had blasted Vosumede’s head off without any hesitation. Despite this fellow looking as though he was extremely powerful, he was no more than a Grade C Super. A single cannon was enough to blow his head.</p>
<p>All the wizards present looked at Han Xiao’s group of four, and before they could even react, a huge change occurred.</p>
<p>Hu!</p>
<p>The moment Vosumede died, all the demonic spirits present lost control and charged out in all directions toward any living being around them.</p>
<p>The two hundred or so wizards immediately snapped back to reality and prepared to face the enemy.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, everyone could clearly see Feidin, who was beside Han Xiao, tapping his forehead and releasing a formless white light to cover the entire region. All the demonic spirits who touched the white light immediately disintegrated.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, all the demonic spirits including the Demonic Spirit King were wiped out.</p>
<p>This time, everyone clearly saw what had happened. Their bodies were rooted to the ground, and a look of disbelief could be seen on their faces.</p>
<p>This… What kind of strength was this?</p>
<p>Was Vosumede really killed by these four? With a single hit?</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>The staff in Wulis’ hands dropped on the ground, and his lips began to tremble.</p>
<p>He had tried to make various predictions about what might happen, but never had he expected such a scenario.</p>
<p>To think that the four people who he thought could be spies for the enemy actually had such frightening strength and killed the enemy leader with a single attack.</p>
<p>The White Sorcerer Wand that he had spent so much effort to create was actually completely useless.</p>
<p>“You… who exactly are all of you?”</p>
<p>Wulis looked at Han Xiao’s group of four with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>This was also the question in the hearts of everyone present.</p>
<p>Vosumede had been ruling over the wizard world for fifty years and was actually easily killed by four reclusive wizards of dubious origins.</p>
<p>This made all the wizards present feel a sense of defeat.</p>
<p>Wulis was the one who was most affected by the scene before him. He felt as though his insistence over the last fifty years was completely meaningless.</p>
<p>Han Xiao frowned and did not reply. He turned around to look at Tomar instead.</p>
<p>Tomar was excited to the point he almost exploded. From beginning to end, his eyes had been fixed on Han Xiao’s group of four. Upon seeing Han Xiao looking at him, Tomar immediately understood the hint.</p>
<p>The next moment, he walked out from the crowd with agitation and spoke loudly to attract everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a need for me to hide anything anymore! I have always known their identities. They are deities, true deities! Only deities have such strength!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, everyone fell into a daze.</p>
<p>De—deities?</p>
<p>This answer was completely out of their imagination.</p>
<p>Everyone felt as though their world view had been lifted before being slammed back onto the ground.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1396 Ranking Restructure, Eldest Brother</h3>
<p>The Hero Spirit Modification Ceremony was currently underway, and on a black mountain peak far away, the Hero Spirits of the Underworld were standing, looking up at Han Xiao and the others in the sky. Their eyes were focused on EsGod, who was transforming.</p>
<p>“Hmph, Black Star kidnapped another newbie,” Old Nine Aegon Vardnadze crossed his arms and snorted.</p>
<p>“Why isn’t this newbie resisting? Did he come in voluntarily? I thought he would only accept his fate after being taught a lesson like Old Nine and Old Ten.” Old Four, who had no sense of existence, teased.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>The corners of Old Ten Dylan’s eyes twitched, and he remained silent.</p>
<p>In the end, he was still forced to accept his fate. Instead of suffering endless torture, he might as well enjoy a limited freedom. He could only hope that Black Star would keep his promise in the future and remove his identity as a Hero Spirit, allowing him to revive normally.</p>
<p>“Humph, I don’t care if this newcomer is willing or not. Anyway, I want to teach him the rules.”</p>
<p>Aegon Vardnadze snorted.</p>
<p>After being taught a lesson, he finally relented. He was not willing to see the newcomers joining the Underworld so comfortably.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Sorokin adjusted his vision and saw the scene in the distance clearly. He could not help but raise his brows with a playful expression.</p>
<div class="pthhh60ccac15e4aca"></div>
<p>“I don’t think you can teach him a lesson. This time, there’s a powerful guy.”</p>
<p>“How strong is he? Can he be stronger than me?” Dylan interrupted.</p>
<p>“You?” Sorokin turned his head and looked at him from head to toe. “I’m afraid you can’t even match his one hand.”</p>
<p>Dylan was instantly unhappy. “We’re both peak Beyond Grade As, can he be stronger than Black Star? If he had that ability, why would he enter the Underworld?”</p>
<p>Sorokin smiled without saying anything.</p>
<p>He was from the same era as EsGod, but the others were different. They did not know EsGod, and he was the only one present who understood how powerful EsGod’s combat capability would be when combined with the mechanisms of the Underworld.</p>
<p>“However…” Sorokin changed the topic and said with a smile,” No matter how strong he is, his seniority is behind us. He is Old Eleven.</p>
<div></div>
<p>On the other side, Han Xiao also noticed the movements of the ten Hero Spirit Kings of the Underworld. He turned around and smiled.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>The ten Guardian Deities of the Underworld had evolved into Inazuma Eleven. They had finally gathered enough to form a football team.</p>
<p>However, EsGod was easy to talk to because Han Xiao’s fists were big, but that did not mean that he had the same attitude toward others. He was not someone who would easily submit to others, and he would not obediently become Old Eleven.</p>
<p>After a while, the Hero Spirit modification was finally completed. EsGod opened his eyes again and felt the form of the Hero Spirit. He nodded in appreciation.</p>
<p>“The fusion of life and death forms a perfectly harmonious structure. This is the ultimate control of Esper Abilities. The Underworld can be called a Space Wonder. The two sisters in history are indeed amazing. Even if I were to develop these two abilities, I might not be able to do better than them.”</p>
<p>“Humph.”</p>
<p>Hila did not like it when others used such a tone to guide her, but since the other party was the ‘God of Esper Abilities’, an absolute master in the field of Esper Abilities, she did not say anything and only snorted to express her dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>At this time, the ten Guardian Deities of the Underworld saw that the ceremony was over and came over to get to know the newcomer. Sorokin greeted them first.</p>
<p>“Yo, look who this is. I thought you would be locked up in a dark prison forever. How did you get released and become a member of the Underworld?”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Sorokin, you’re here too?”</p>
<p>EsGod looked over.</p>
<p>“Hehe, looks like you’ve been locked up for too long. You have no idea what happened in the past few years,” Sorokin shrugged and pointed at the Hero Spirits beside him. “Let me introduce them. These seven are Beyond Grade As who joined the Underworld in the exploration era. These two are Beyond Grade As in history. They were revived by Black Star and are both peak Beyond Grade As. We are the Hero Spirit Kings of the Underworld…”</p>
<p>“Revived?” A look of interest flashed through EsGod’s eyes. He turned to look at Han Xiao and said with a smile, “Looks like you’ve done a lot of things in the past hundred years.”</p>
<p>“What else? Do you think I’ve been doing nothing all these years?” Han Xiao shook his head. “In the past hundred years, there have been many changes in the galactic structure. You should ask Sorokin about these things. You guys know each other after all, he will definitely be happy to explain to you.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, as long as you owe me a promise coin… Don’t look so confused. Come, let me introduce you to the currency of the Underworld…”</p>
<p>Sorokin was extremely passionate. He could not wait to promote the financial system that he had created.</p>
<p>However, before he could say anything, Dylan interrupted him and sized EsGod up.</p>
<p>“I haven’t asked for your name. What’s yours?”</p>
<p>EsGod turned to look at him. “You don’t need to know my name. Just call me EsGod.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“God of Esper Abilities.”</p>
<p>Dylan laughed and said sarcastically, “Not even the most powerful Espers in history dared to call themselves that. Old Eleven, do you deserve this name?” “Old Eleven?” EsGod raised his brows and counted the people in front of him. He immediately understood the order of ranking.</p>
<p>“You’re not convinced?” Dylan snorted.</p>
<p>“If we were still alive, you would be dead by now.” EsGod’s tone was calm. As someone who made the galactic society tremble in fear, he was not a good-tempered person.</p>
<p>“Sure, let’s fight. Sorokin said you’re very strong, but I want to see how you kill me.”</p>
<p>Dylan sneered. He remembered Sorokin’s words and refused to believe them.</p>
<p>In any case, they were all Hero Spirits who would not die. If they were not convinced, they would fight. Han Xiao could not help but glance at him. He did not find it strange. Dylan had a foul mouth, and he also had the ability to taunt others. He had always liked to stir up trouble. Furthermore, after accepting Hero Spirit’s identity, this guy no longer had anything to worry about. It was as if he had released his nature. His foul mouth became worse, and his taunts became more and more casual. His personality was extremely unrestrained.</p>
<div></div>
<p>They were all Hero Spirits, and without Aurora giving them life force, no one would be able to do anything. It was likely that Dylan was just enjoying the feeling of the other side not being able to do anything to him.</p>
<p>“What do you say?” EsGod turned to look at Han Xiao.</p>
<p>“Since that’s the case, Aurora and I will temporarily give you a body. You guys can rearrange your positions, and strength is everything.” Hila’s eyes lit up. She was most willing to watch others fight a bloody battle, so she immediately decided.</p>
<p>“I agree.” Sorokin’s eyes lit up, and he immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Although he was not the strongest among the Hero Spirit Kings, he was definitely ranked at the top. At the very least, he did not have to continue being Old Eight.</p>
<p>“That’s right, I agree.” Dylan snorted and pointed at EsGod. “I hope you can let me enjoy myself.”</p>
<p>“I’m in a good mood today, so let’s celebrate my new life with you.”</p>
<p>EsGod paused and turned to look at Evans.</p>
<p>“This time, I’ll show you the combat style of this ability. Watch and learn.”</p>
<p>Evans immediately perked up.</p>
<p>Not long after, Aurora was called over by Hila to build a body for the numerous Hero Kings.</p>
<p>Han Xiao brought them to the main universe and found a desolate universe belt as the battlefield.</p>
<p>Three days later, the eleven of them returned to the Underworld in their Hero Spirit form. They did not mention the battle at all and only silently rearranged themselves.</p>
<p>EsGod became the eldest brother out of nowhere, Dylan became the second, Sorokin became the third, and Aegon Vardnadze became the fourth.</p>
<p>Although the first and second positions were only one position away from each other, there was a huge gap between their strengths. As a spectator, Han Xiao had finally witnessed the strength of EsGod when he was at his peak. He was much stronger than when he was alive, and it was a piece of cake for him to beat up Dylan.</p>
<p>In Han Xiao’s eyes, he was probably the only one in the entire universe who could easily take down EsGod. The others would at most fight to a draw, and EsGod with no mental load would not be afraid of anyone but him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wuornos’ chances of winning were even lower than that of Herberlon. Even if his Energy Rank was higher, he might not be EsGod’s match. After all, he was an Esper. As long as he was touched by [Esper Silence), he would basically be dead.</p>
<p>On the other side, in the conference room of the three Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>The three leaders had just finished a meeting and were arranging the documents when Louis suddenly thought of something. He looked at Marbruce and asked curiously,</p>
<p>“How did your deal with Black Star go? I heard Gaud has returned?”</p>
<p>Marbruce paused and slowly nodded.</p>
<p>The Pope narrowed his eyes and slowly said, “So, Gaud was really captured by Black Star. How did your dynasty deal with him?”</p>
<p>“…I’m still investigating the inside story. You don’t have to worry about the details.”</p>
<p>Marbruce shook his head.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the two of them guessed that the dynasty had most likely been defeated by Black Star and could not help but laugh inwardly. The Pope coughed and said calmly, “Black Star is fully grown, so let’s not bother about him for now. No matter what, we have brought back a direct Beyond Grade A with extraordinary potential. In the future, he will definitely become an important pillar of our individual strength. Congratulations on obtaining a new National Pillar. Train Gaud well.”</p>
<p>Because he had Wuornos at home who was preparing to advance to the Transcendent Grade, the Pope was very open-minded and did not mind that the dynasty had regained Gaud. Furthermore, from the standpoint of the three Universal Civilizations, this was also a good thing</p>
<p>Marbruce’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Others thought that Gaud was still the Super High-Risk Esper Ability possessor with unparalleled potential, and they were congratulating him for obtaining the potential seed. It was a kind of mockery, and he did not feel good about it.</p>
<p>Marbruce did not want the two of them to know that the dynasty had made a loss this time and used EsGod to exchange for a cripple. He had no choice but to suppress his anger and smile.</p>
<p>At the border of the Flickering World.</p>
<p>Huge engineering spaceships cruised through space one after another. Planetary harvesting devices covered the planets one after another, carrying out destructive development, draining the planet’s core, crushing the planet, and disintegrating it into various substances that flowed into the enormous storage pods. It was like a swarm of locusts sweeping across the galaxy, leaving only barren land wherever it passed.</p>
<p>There were a few Star Clusters at the border of the Flickering World. Originally, it was a place with plenty of resources, but under the destructive development of the three Universal Civilizations, it was gradually turning into a desolate universe belt. It was currently transforming into a strategic deep region to face the World Tree’s attacks in the future. All the valuable resources were taken away, leaving nothing behind for the World Tree. At this moment, at the edge of the development zone, a small dynasty fleet was escorting an ordinary spaceship with the Black Star Army’s insignia. In the spaceship, Bun-Hit-Dog was arranging the materials he had collected for this trip. The players around him all had the ID prefix of Bun-Hit-Dog’s studio, and they were all his employees.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity that the dynasty did not allow us to go deep into the development zone. This time, we only managed to gather some scraps. It’s not enough to make a video of the three Universal Civilizations preparing for war…”</p>
<p>Bun-Hit-Dog sighed, not too satisfied with his gains.</p>
<p>“Be content. The three Universal Civilizations have already made an exception by allowing us to take a look at the periphery.” The assistant, Little Wheat, curled his lips.</p>
<p>Currently, most of the players were participating in the harassment battle at the frontline, but Bun-Hit-Dog did not stay at the frontline all the time. Because there were battle reports everywhere, it was not convenient for him to make videos. He keenly felt that the changes in the backlines would be more valuable, so he brought a group of studio employees back to the explored universe to search for news everywhere.</p>
<p>Not long after, Bun-Hit-Dog set his sights on the two news locations, the Black Star Training Base and the three Universal Civilizations’ war preparations. However, the training base did not allow outsiders to enter, so he could only observe the latter.</p>
<p>Bun-Hit-Dog was doing quite well in some of the departments of the three Universal Civilizations. Firstly, the accounts under his studio all prioritized optimizing charisma, and they specialized in building a good relationship with various characters. Secondly, Bun-Hit-Dog kept promoting himself and pulled many players to be his backers, letting the three Universal Civilizations know that he had a special influence among the Immortals and became the exclusive media of the Immortals. Thirdly, he had the special identity of a reporter from the Black Star Army, and his studio was attached to the intelligence department of the army. It was a branch that was officially recognized, and it had a news license.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the eyes of the three Universal Civilizations, Bun-Hit-Dog represented the special intelligence personnel of the immortals group of the Black Star Army. He had some face and was able to discuss business and cooperation with the various organizations as a player. This was also the way some guilds did things. With so many conveniences, Bun-Hit-Dog’s business flourished.</p>
<p>He submitted a visit request to the three Universal Civilizations, and after some negotiation, Bun-Hit-Dog and the others finally obtained permission to come to the edge of this border development zone to take a look. However, the results were not as expected, and they were now on their way</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>“What should I do? Although I don’t lack material now, it’s all old talk. I need sensational news!”</p>
<p>Bun-Hit-Dog tugged at his hair with a troubled expression.</p>
<p>At this moment, a chat notification popped up on the forums. An employee had sent a private message. “Boss, I made a huge discovery. This material will definitely scare you to death!” Bun-Hit-Dog looked at his ID and remembered that he was the supervisor in charge of the dynasty’s news materials.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Tell me what you found!”</p>
<div class="kcnig60ccac15e4aa1"></div>
<p>“This is what one of my subordinates heard from a dynasty logistics officer. It is said that not long ago, Black Star went to kill EsGod and showed his strength that surpasses Beyond Grade A. He even handed Gaud over…”</p>
<p>This small supervisor spoke with confidence. He did not know about the behind-the-scenes deal that Black Star made and only talked about what he did on the surface, but this was enough to shock Bun-Hit-Dog. “Is this information true ?” Bun-Hit-Dog felt his bladder tighten.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That employee of mine has a very good relationship with that dynasty officer. Anyway, I found out from him that this officer was present at the scene!”</p>
<p>“Well done! All the money spent over the years was not wasted!” Bun-Hit-Dog slammed the table excitedly.</p>
<p>The size of his studio was not small. He had arranged for a regional branch in some large organizations and had his employees specially make friends with the people from the various departments of these large organizations. He had been investing money to form an intelligence network, and occasionally, he would get insider information from these people. Of course, with his personal assets, there was no way he could open such a huge business. There were also sponsors behind him.</p>
<div class="bfgsj60ccac15e4af0"></div>
<p>As for the biggest sponsor, it was Black Star himself. Bun-Hit-Dog had thought that Han Xiao had a good impression of him, which was why he had received the funds.</p>
<p>The inside story this time was the biggest piece of news he had ever received. Although he did not know the reason, just the fact that Black Star had broken past Beyond Grade A and Gaud’s disappearance had something to do with Black Star was enough for him to make a video.</p>
<p>Even if it was just groundless speculation, the gimmick was enough to attract attention.</p>
<p>Bun-Hit-Dog immediately slammed the table.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and send me the material. The video has to be uploaded within three days. You guys have to work overnight. I’m going to be popular again!”</p>

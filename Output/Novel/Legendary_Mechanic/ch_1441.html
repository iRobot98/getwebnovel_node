				<h4>Chapter 1441 Uneven Distribution of the Spoils</h4>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The gigantic Pivotal Snake coiled around the World Tree and bit it.</p>
<p>Although it was only an illusory Virtual Life Form and could not harm physical objects, the Pivotal Snake’s method of harming the World Tree was an Information Form channel that only targeted the Mother Tree’s will. The World Tree’s main body struggled frantically, trying to break free from the Pivotal Snake. However, the waving roots could not touch the Pivotal Snake’s virtual body at all.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>Although the World Tree was strong, the reason why the Pivotal Snake was its natural enemy was because of its unresolvable restraint. The will of the Mother Tree did not have the time to care about Han Xiao, and the mental shock was immediately silenced. It was held up by the Pivotal Snake and struggled non-stop, like a young girl anxiously grabbing her clothes and not letting anyone strip her naked.</p>
<p>An endless stream of machinery poured out from the Godly Stronghold and fused into the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, causing Han Xiao’s body to expand rapidly. His arms could gradually wrap around the trunk as though he was going to uproot the World Tree. While the mother tree’s will was in chaos, Han Xiao did not hesitate to use his energy to infiltrate the World Tree’s body and attempt to form a Soul Connection, dyeing the other party with his own color and turning it into his own shape. To the members of the World Tree Family, this feeling was akin to having their faith insulted. Countless people charged toward Han Xiao with bloodshot eyes, and batches of them were destroyed midway.</p>
<p>Because of Han Xiao’s actions, the World Tree fleet was inevitably thrown into chaos. The galactic alliance army naturally would not let go of such a good opportunity. The fleet quickly penetrated the defensive perimeter and reached the fourth layer very quickly, suffering an even more intense counterattack. The troops at the front were not far from Han Xiao, and they all provided firepower support to help him intercept the World Tree’s troops. Energy beams shot everywhere, detonating a series of battleships on the battlefield. On the other side, seeing that Black Star had successfully arrived beside the World Tree’s main body, the commanders in the strategic command center were excited. “Good! Black Star has already stepped on the World Tree Civilization’s weakness!”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to rely on him to destroy the World Tree’s main body. We have to protect him and let him focus on dealing with the World Tree.”</p>
<p>“Even at a conservative estimate, our chances of winning are more than 95%!”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“The World Tree has no chance of turning the tables!”</p>
<div class="sdilz60f23d3b478fe"></div>
<p>The officers were excited. The goal of the three Universal Civilizations in starting this battle was to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop, hoping to finish everything. Thus, they had gathered most of the forces of the explored universe. Although it could not be said that it was to the extent of win or die trying, if they lost this war, the three Universal Civilizations would also suffer heavy losses, and the gains would not make up for the losses. Therefore, before going out to war, many officers had made a military pledge that they would only win and not lose. However, the officers did not want to lie to themselves.</p>
<p>Their confidence came from Black Star and the Pivotal Snake. If they did not have such a trump card, they would not have dared to say they would definitely win. Seeing that Black Star had killed the Tree God, broken through the encirclement, and was uprooting the mother tree, almost single-handedly pushing the battle forward, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. They felt that they trusted the right person… As expected, this war was still being carried by Black Star.</p>
<p>However, the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations were not happy at all. Instead, their expressions were solemn, as though they had some concerns.</p>
<p>The Pope hesitated for a moment before speaking “Why do I feel like Black Star isn’t destroying the main body of the World Tree?” Hearing this, the officers were stunned. They suppressed the joy in their hearts and carefully observed Han Xiao’s actions toward the World Tree. The more they looked, the stranger they felt. “That does seem to be the case… He is not continuing to attack, more like he is subduing the World Tree’s main body… Is he trying to control the World Tree “</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked and understood that the situation had become complicated.</p>
<p>The officers turned around, and as expected, the expressions of the three leaders became extremely ugly. “What a great Black Star! I knew he had other plans. Isn’t he afraid of dying from overeating</p>
<p>Louis was furious.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Our worries were right. He used us to defeat the World Tree’s troops and create an opportunity for him to subdue the World Tree’s main body. We can’t let him achieve his goal!” The Pope was furious.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>The World Tree was too powerful. No matter where it landed, it was a threat to the three Universal Civilizations. The three Universal Civilizations only wanted to destroy it, and they did not even dare to take the risk of capturing it. Black Star was already an existence beyond the norm, and the three Universal Civilizations could no longer control him. If Black Star was to obtain the World Tree, he would be a threat to them. It would be equivalent to him obtaining a Universal Civilization, and he would be able to rival the entire explored universe. In fact, he might even surpass them to a certain extent. It would be enough to shake the foundation of their rule!</p>
<p>Although the internal conflicts were temporarily suppressed by the invasion of the enemy, the three Universal Civilizations did not forget the fear of losing control over the individual strengths. They still had conflicts with Black Star that were difficult to reconcile. Once the war ended, these problems would surface again, so the three of them would not watch the Beyond Grade As control the World Tree.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the war had been going on for more than ten years, and the three Universal Civilizations were the main victims. They had wasted so much time in the war and lost countless resources. Now that they were finally going to reap the fruits of their labor, they naturally did not want to let Han Xiao steal their fruits.</p>
<p>We were the ones who mobilized the army to resist the World Tree, and we suffered the most losses. However, we created an opportunity for the other in the end. Who can tolerate this! Even if Black Star’s contribution was high, they could not allow him! In the eyes of the three of them, Black Star was showing his true intentions. Fighting against the enemy together was just an excuse on the surface. Black Star’s real goal was to use the galactic society’s troops to obtain the World Tree for himself! The three of them actually had some guesses about Han Xiao’s selfishness, but it was useless. The war still depended on Black Star, and it was almost certain that they would reach this stage.</p>
<p>“We can’t let Black Star succeed.”</p>
<p>“Then what should we do? Are we going to fire at Black Star?”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? We haven’t even won yet, and you still dare to have internal strife in front of such a powerful enemy? What are you thinking ?”</p>
<p>The officers were agitated and started arguing. Simon made a prompt decision and shouted, “Inform the direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations to stop providing cover fire to Black Star and attack the World Tree’s main body. We must blow it up before Black Star succeeds!” They had to stop Han Xiao, but they could not turn against him. Thus, they could only change their tactics temporarily and race Black Star for time to destroy the target.</p>
<div></div>
<p>However, everyone knew that the World Tree fleet would definitely protect the mother tree and stop their firepower. Furthermore, it was impossible for Black Star to not be prepared, so he had definitely taken some measures to stop them. “It all depends on human effort…” This thought flashed through the minds of many of the officers. Their faces were stiff, and their attitudes were not optimistic. The order was quickly passed down. The direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations did not think too much about it and immediately fired at the World Tree itself. However, most of the attacks were stopped by the World Tree fleet halfway.</p>
<p>Just as the three Universal Civilizations’ fleets did this, the Black Star Army and all the other Beyond Grade A organizations also reacted. They immediately started to slack off and moved around to block the attacks of the three Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>The members of the Beyond Grade A Association also started to move. Some of them deliberately guided the World Tree fleet to attack the direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations through various positions, while others activated their AOE fighting style that did not differentiate between friend and foe. They attacked the enemy and the three Universal Civilizations together, indirectly disrupting the three Universal Civilizations’ formation.</p>
<p>Because many of their ‘allies’ were causing trouble, the coordination of the Galactic Alliance Army was disrupted. Their attacks suddenly slowed down, and their advancement became stagnant. They were dragged into the chaotic battle by the berserk World Tree fleet and could not withdraw for a while. “Damn it!”</p>
<p>The Pope was furious. He wanted to punch the table, but the remote projection could not touch the real thing. His fist passed through the table.</p>
<p>“I told you Black Star was prepared.” Marbruce also had an unfriendly expression. The World Tree’s main body struggled frantically, trying to break free from the Pivotal Snake. However, the waving roots could not touch the Pivotal Snake’s virtual body at all.</p>
<p>Although the World Tree was strong, the reason why the Pivotal Snake was its natural enemy was because of its unresolvable restraint. The will of the Mother Tree did not have the time to care about Han Xiao, and the mental shock was immediately silenced. It was held up by the Pivotal Snake and struggled non-stop, like a young girl anxiously grabbing her clothes and not letting anyone strip her naked.</p>
<p>An endless stream of machinery poured out from the Godly Stronghold and fused into the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, causing Han Xiao’s body to expand rapidly. His arms could gradually wrap around the trunk as though he was going to uproot the World Tree. While the mother tree’s will was in chaos, Han Xiao did not hesitate to use his energy to infiltrate the World Tree’s body and attempt to form a Soul Connection, dyeing the other party with his own color and turning it into his own shape.</p>
<p>To the members of the World Tree Family, this feeling was akin to having their faith insulted. Countless people charged toward Han Xiao with bloodshot eyes, and batches of them were destroyed midway.</p>
<p>Because of Han Xiao’s actions, the World Tree fleet was inevitably thrown into chaos. The galactic alliance army naturally would not let go of such a good opportunity. The fleet quickly penetrated the defensive perimeter and reached the fourth layer very quickly, suffering an even more intense counterattack. The troops at the front were not far from Han Xiao, and they all provided firepower support to help him intercept the World Tree’s troops.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Energy beams shot everywhere, detonating a series of battleships on the battlefield. On the other side, seeing that Black Star had successfully arrived beside the World Tree’s main body, the commanders in the strategic command center were excited. “Good! Black Star has already stepped on the World Tree Civilization’s weakness!”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to rely on him to destroy the World Tree’s main body. We have to protect him and let him focus on dealing with the World Tree.” “Even at a conservative estimate, our chances of winning are more than 95%!” “The World Tree has no chance of turning the tables!”</p>
<p>The officers were excited.</p>
<p>The goal of the three Universal Civilizations in starting this battle was to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop, hoping to finish everything. Thus, they had gathered most of the forces of the explored universe. Although it could not be said that it was to the extent of win or die trying, if they lost this war, the three Universal Civilizations would also suffer heavy losses, and the gains would not make up for the losses. Therefore, before going out to war, many officers had made a military pledge that they would only win and not lose. However, the officers did not want to lie to themselves.</p>
<p>Their confidence came from Black Star and the Pivotal Snake. If they did not have such a trump card, they would not have dared to say they would definitely win. Seeing that Black Star had killed the Tree God, broken through the encirclement, and was uprooting the mother tree, almost single-handedly pushing the battle forward, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. They felt that they trusted the right person… As expected, this war was still being carried by Black Star. However, the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations were not happy at all. Instead, their expressions were solemn, as though they had some concerns.</p>
<p>The Pope hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>“Why do I feel like Black Star isn’t destroying the main body of the World Tree?” Hearing this, the officers were stunned. They suppressed the joy in their hearts and carefully observed Han Xiao’s actions toward the World Tree. The more they looked, the stranger they felt. “That does seem to be the case…</p>
<p>He is not continuing to attack, more like he is subduing the World Tree’s main body…</p>
<div></div>
<p>Is he trying to control the World Tree P”. Everyone was shocked and understood that the situation had become complicated. The officers turned around, and as expected, the expressions of the three leaders became extremely ugly. “What a great Black Star! I knew he had other plans. Isn’t he afraid of dying from overeating</p>
<p>Louis was furious.</p>
<p>“Our worries were right. He used us to defeat the World Tree’s troops and create an opportunity for him to subdue the World Tree’s main body. We can’t let him achieve his</p>
<p>goal!”</p>
<p>The Pope was furious. The World Tree was too powerful. No matter where it landed, it was a threat to the three Universal Civilizations. The three Universal Civilizations only wanted to destroy it, and they did not even dare to take the risk of capturing it. Black Star was already an existence beyond the norm, and the three Universal Civilizations could no longer control him. If Black Star was to obtain the World Tree, he would be a threat to them. It would be equivalent to him obtaining a Universal Civilization, and he would be able to rival the entire explored universe. In fact, he might even surpass them to a certain extent. It would be enough to shake the foundation of their rule!</p>
<p>Although the internal conflicts were temporarily suppressed by the invasion of the enemy, the three Universal Civilizations did not forget the fear of losing control over the individual strengths. They still had conflicts with Black Star that were difficult to reconcile. Once the war ended, these problems would surface again, so the three of them would not watch the Beyond Grade As control the World Tree.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the war had been going on for more than ten years, and the three Universal Civilizations were the main victims. They had wasted so much time in the war and lost countless resources. Now that they were finally going to reap the fruits of their labor, they naturally did not want to let Han Xiao steal their fruits.</p>
<p>We were the ones who mobilized the army to resist the World Tree, and we suffered the most losses. However, we created an opportunity for the other in the end. Who can tolerate this!</p>
<p>Even if Black Star’s contribution was high, they could not allow him!</p>
<p>In the eyes of the three of them, Black Star was showing his true intentions. Fighting against the enemy together was just an excuse on the surface. Black Star’s real goal was to use the galactic society’s troops to obtain the World Tree for himself! The three of them actually had some guesses about Han Xiao’s selfishness, but it was useless. The war still depended on Black Star, and it was almost certain that they would reach this stage. “We can’t let Black Star succeed.” “Then what should we do? Are we going to fire at Black Star?” “Are you crazy? We haven’t even won yet, and you still dare to have internal strife in front of such a powerful enemy? What are you thinking ?”</p>
<p>The officers were agitated and started arguing. Simon made a prompt decision and shouted, “Inform the direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations to stop providing cover fire to Black Star and attack the World Tree’s main body. We must blow it up before Black Star succeeds!”</p>
<p>They had to stop Han Xiao, but they could not turn against him. Thus, they could only change their tactics temporarily and race Black Star for time to destroy the target. However, everyone knew that the World Tree fleet would definitely protect the mother tree and stop their firepower. Furthermore, it was impossible for Black Star to not be prepared, so he had definitely taken some measures to stop them. “It all depends on human effort…”</p>
<p>This thought flashed through the minds of many of the officers. Their faces were stiff, and their attitudes were not optimistic. The order was quickly passed down. The direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations did not think too much about it and immediately fired at the World Tree itself. However, most of the attacks were stopped by the World Tree fleet halfway. Just as the three Universal Civilizations’ fleets did this, the Black Star Army and all the other Beyond Grade A organizations also reacted.</p>
<p>They immediately started to slack off and moved around to block the attacks of the three Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>The members of the Beyond Grade A Association also started to move. Some of them deliberately guided the World Tree fleet to attack the direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations through various positions, while others activated their AOE fighting style that did not differentiate between friend and foe. They attacked the enemy and the three Universal Civilizations together, indirectly disrupting the three Universal Civilizations’ formation.</p>
<p>Because many of their ‘allies’ were causing trouble, the coordination of the Galactic Alliance Army was disrupted. Their attacks suddenly slowed down, and their advancement became stagnant. They were dragged into the chaotic battle by the berserk World Tree fleet and could not withdraw for a while. “Damn it!”</p>
<p>The Pope was furious. He wanted to punch the table, but the remote projection could not touch the real thing. His fist passed through the table.</p>
<p>“I told you Black Star was prepared.” Marbruce also had an unfriendly expression. Both parties were aware of their respective goals and were obstructing each other, but on the surface, they still had to pretend to fight together as if all their actions were focused on attacking the World Tree. This situation could be said to be hiding different purposes behind the semblance of the accord. The three leaders did not want to go against the others and affect the war, but they felt that they had no choice.</p>
<p>Due to the conflict between the two sides, the galactic alliance army had split into three parties. One was the three Universal Civilizations’ direct troops that wanted to destroy World Tree’s main body, and the other was the Beyond Grade A forces who provided cover for Black Star and obstructed the three Universal Civilizations. The final party was the remaining allied forces who were fighting seriously and were shocked by the ‘chaos’ on the two sides.</p>
<p>They did not know what was going on. Why did the other two suddenly drag each other down? The galactic alliance army was in chaos, but the conflict between the three Universal Civilizations and the Beyond Grade A organizations did not affect Han Xiao’s process of subduing the World Tree.</p>
<p>Han Xiao’s energy continued to seep into the depths of the World Tree’s main body. The will of the Mother Tree had already been completely destroyed by the Pivotal Snake, and there was no way to stop his assault.</p>
<p>Amidst the spiritual entanglement, illusions flashed past Han Xiao’s eyes, and he saw the history of the World Tree’s growth.</p>
<p>When it was weak, it was worshiped by certain races and was offered all kinds of sacrifices. The will of the Mother Tree slowly took shape during this process, providing convenience to the races under them while guiding them to expand outward. After completing the accumulation, the World Tree then embarked on the bloody path of rising up, becoming a Universal Predator. One race after another became vassals, and civilizations became food. Gradually, it started to grow, and its abilities became richer and richer.</p>
<p>Countless memories appeared before Han Xiao’s eyes. In a daze, he seemed to see a small tree sprout growing rapidly, eventually covering the sun and standing on top of the starry sky. Countless wormholes appeared between the tree branches, each leading to a different world. Endless cosmic radiation storms swept past, but it was like a breeze, only able to make the lush leaves sway slightly. Trillions of Blessed Race and Believers were spread out on the roots, worshipping sincerely. This scene gave off a majestic and mysterious feeling. Buzz!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Xiao’s eyes cleared, and he stepped out of the illusion. A new existence had appeared in his senses. It was the World Tree that had successfully formed the Soul Connection.</p>
<p>At this moment, the will of the mother tree finally reached its limit, and it was completely devoured by the Pivotal Snake. The next moment, the World Tree’s main body stopped struggling and lost any ability to move independently, turning into a dead object. Han Xiao’s body trembled, and a stream of information flowed into his mind. It contained the various abilities of the World Tree, as well as the control rights. Although the authority of the Tree Kings was high, they were still the subordinates of the World Tree, while Han Xiao’s authority was above the Mother Tree and was not under any restrictions.</p>
<p>The surging new energy flowed into Han Xiao’s body through the soul connection, providing him with a new enhancement, pushing his energy level up.</p>
<p>Hiss…</p>
<p>Han Xiao could not help but take a deep breath. His entire body was filled with energy. Just as he was about to take back the Pivotal Snake, he realized that the Pivotal Snake did not stop. Instead, it dived into the World Tree and merged into it.</p>
<p>Han Xiao looked at the interface and saw a new suffix in the name of the World Tree.</p>
<p>(World Tree (Complete Form)]! “Hmm? Could it be that the Pivotal Snake was not only a natural enemy, but it could also fuse with the World Tree and complete it?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao was shocked.</p>
<p>This ability did not appear on the attribute panel of the Pivotal Snake. He had only seen it now.</p>
<p>Just as the Pivotal Snake fused into the World Tree, Han Xiao noticed a change. He had just formed a Soul Connection with the World Tree, and it was only the shallowest layer. It was still very weak, but at this moment, the Soul Connection was suddenly strengthened, and it became many times stronger.</p>
<p>If his previous invasion progress on the World Tree was 10%, it was now more than 80%!</p>
<p>“Could it be that the Pivotal Snake can help the controller better control the World Tree?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Suppressing the surprise in his heart, Han Xiao felt the power of the World Tree. He could not be more satisfied. The World Tree’s independent will had been cleared, and it had become a tool without any thoughts. It was completely controlled by him and could be used at ease.</p>
<p>Due to the devouring and conversion characteristics, the World Tree could be regarded as a growth type of Universal Treasure. However, he did not need to start from zero because the World Tree had already matured. Controlling it was equivalent to gaining the loyalty of the entire World Tree Civilization!</p>
<p>The power of this thing was countless times more terrifying than the inheritance of the Underworld that Hila and Aurora had!</p>
<p>“Cannot blame the three Universal Civilizations for wanting to destroy my goal…” Han Xiao turned to look at the battlefield. His eyes flashed, and he suddenly activated the authority of the World Tree to recall all the World Tree fleets. The World Tree fleet, which had been fighting back fearlessly a second ago, suddenly stopped fighting. Without saying a word, they turned around and flew into the roots, turning back into their information form and entering the mother tree world.</p>
<p>For a moment, the battlefield was much emptier, and only the galactic alliance army was left.</p>
<p>Originally, the members of the World Tree were all filled with the desire to fight to the death. However, the moment the will of the mother tree disappeared and Han Xiao replaced the control, everyone’s hostility disappeared. Just as they were feeling lost, a new mission arrived. They would not disobey the orders of the World Tree and immediately ceased fire and retreated.</p>
<p>“No matter how tragic the counterattack was, they were just a bunch of puppets. With the owner changed, they have to listen obediently…”</p>
<p>Seeing this, Han Xiao sighed. However, sympathy was sympathy, and he would not foolishly let the World Tree Civilization go free. This was the World Tree’s own foundation.</p>
<p>Seeing that the enemies had left, the galactic alliance army was stunned. They then looked at Han Xiao beside the tree and were overjoyed.</p>
<p>“We won ?”</p>
<p>“We’re still alive!”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha-I knew I could trust Black Star!”</p>
<p>Countless soldiers were overjoyed, and the atmosphere of excitement and surprise quickly spread throughout the entire army. Every combat channel was filled with wild cheers, and even many players who had yet to spend all their revivals were affected and cheered along</p>
<p>However, when most of the fleets stopped firing, the direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations still did not stop firing at the World Tree itself.</p>
<p>Without the obstruction of the World Tree fleet, the direct troops of the three Universal Civilizations had a clear way. This scene immediately caused the cheers to stop, attracting the shocked gazes of countless comrades.</p>
<p>“Oh? You still haven’t given up. Do you want to pretend you know nothing and try to destroy the World Tree one last time while I haven’t notified you?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. He knew what the three Universal Civilizations were thinking</p>
<p>He suddenly waved his hand, and a thick psionic barrier surrounded the World Tree to block the attacks of the fleet.</p>
<p>At the same time, Han Xiao shouted in the channel.</p>
<p>“You can stop the fire. I’ve controlled the World Tree.”</p>
<p>After waiting for a few seconds, the Pope’s solemn voice suddenly sounded in the channel.</p>
<p>“Since that’s the case, let’s destroy it. It’s still a threat to the world!”</p>
<p>“There’s no need. I’ve already subdued the World Tree.”</p>
<p>“It’s not enough! Only by destroying it will we be able to completely eliminate the hidden threat! Even if it’s you, we won’t be at ease!”</p>
<p>“Do you want to cast us aside so soon?” Han Xiao said with a smile that was not a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re mistaken. We’re only doing this to maintain the peace of the galaxy. No one in the galactic society wants to face such a disaster again!” the Pope said with a deep voice.</p>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head. “Stop it. Don’t make the situation too ugly. We just won. Do you want the other allies to see our internal strife?”</p>
<p>Before the Pope could reply, Marbruce interrupted.</p>
<p>“Black Star, this is the only thing we can’t compromise on! You’re the one who should stop. You’ve already made enough contributions, don’t be stubborn! Let go, you’re still the Universe’s Hero of the Final War!”</p>
<p>“Looks like you won’t regret it until things are too late…”</p>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the expressions of the three leaders and the officers turned grave.</p>
<p>They knew that Black Star would not give up so easily, and they were already prepared for a conflict to break out. However, their goal was only to get rid of the World Tree’s main body. Although they were suspected of burning the bridge after crossing it, their goal to get rid of the hidden threat could be accepted by others. In their opinion, if Black Star went on a killing spree against them, it would definitely incur the wrath of the masses. The reputation that he had accumulated during the war would immediately collapse, and the allies of the other civilizations present would also stand on their side to resist Black Star together.</p>
<p>Thus, despite being nervous, the three of them were not afraid of Black Star fighting back. In fact, they were even looking forward to this development.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, the three of them widened their eyes.</p>
<p>Han Xiao did not make a move. Instead, he raised his hand and patted the World Tree. The huge World Tree shrank rapidly and turned into a green stream of light that flew into Han Xiao’s palm, disappearing in front of everyone.</p>
<p>“This…”</p>
<p>Marbruce and the other two were stunned.</p>
<p>The battle with the World Tree fleet previously had given them the impression that the mother tree could not move, so they felt that they had the upper hand. Thus, the three of them would rather take the risk of angering Black Star and gather their forces to destroy the World Tree.</p>
<p>However, the three of them did not expect Black Star to be able to store the World Tree and do something that the World Tree Blessed Race could not. They could not react in time. What was there to destroy now? In fact, Han Xiao could not do this in the beginning. It was all due to the Pivotal Snake strengthening his Soul Connection exponentially, crossing many stages. This allowed him to unlock more functions, including putting the World Tree into the Transcendent’s inner space.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the inner space was also a type of secondary dimension. It could also allow the World Tree to take root in it. This way, the inner space would receive a huge enhancement and become extremely tough. Furthermore, there was no need to care about the weakness of the enemy targeting the World Tree’s main body. It was equivalent to carrying the mother tree with him. It was very convenient.</p>
<p>Han Xiao had originally planned to use other methods to force the three Universal Civilizations to stop, but the direct conflict was unavoidable, and it would damage his reputation more or less. However, with this new ability, he changed his plan at the last minute and made the three Universal Civilizations lose their target. This would save him a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Just as the three leaders were at a loss, Han Xiao’s remote projection appeared in the strategic command center.</p>
<p>“What do the three of you say now?”</p>
<p>The faces of Marbruce and the other two flickered. They did not respond.</p>
<p>Only when the World Tree’s main body was exposed in front of the army would they have a chance. There was no chance now. As for letting Black Star take the initiative to hand it over… the three of them knew it. No matter how arrogant they were, they did not think that they had that much face.</p>
<p>“Black Star, you’ve succeeded. You must be very happy now…”</p>
<p>Marbruce had a complicated expression on his face. His tone was bitter, and there was a hint of unwillingness and mockery.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am indeed very happy. The war has finally ended, and everyone is cheering. Are you not happy about this?” Han Xiao raised his brows.</p>
<div class="joqsp60f23d3b478ca"></div>
<p>The three of them had solemn expressions.</p>
<p>It would be weird if we were happy. Who knows if we have just left the tiger’s den but entered the wolf’s den again…</p>
<p>Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled and did not continue teasing them.</p>
<p>Since he had already taken advantage of them, there was no need for him to pretend to be innocent. There would be plenty of time for him to settle scores in the future. He did not plan to argue with the three of them about what had happened just now. This was not the right time.</p>
<p>This time, Han Xiao changed the topic and said, “Alright, let’s not talk anymore. Let’s get down to business. I have a plan, and I hope you guys can cooperate.” “…What plan?”</p>
<div class="unjji60f23d3b4792c"></div>
<p>The three of them were surprised.</p>
<p>We just won, what is Black Star planning?</p>
<p>“Don’t leak the news of us defeating the World Tree Civilization. This Galactic Alliance Army’s composition is complicated. It’s best to control them for the time being.”</p>
<p>“Er… What are you planning?” Marbruce was confused. Han Xiao smiled and said,</p>
<p>“Haven’t you guys been trying to find out who leaked the information? I said it was a third party, but you guys just don’t believe me. I just happened to obtain the Information Form Warning Network technology from the World Tree. I don’t have to explain the effects. You guys have already experienced it. This way, you might be able to find traces of a third party. What do you guys think?” The eyes of the trio lit up.</p>

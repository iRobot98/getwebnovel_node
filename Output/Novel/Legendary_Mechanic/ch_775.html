				<h3>Chapter 775 The Battle Begins!</h3>
<p>Everyone in all the spaceships stopped talking, and their gazes were fixed on the transportation door in the middle of the battlefield.</p>
<p>The wormhole-like transportation door enlarged continuously as though it was limitless. The largest spaceship present currently was the armed satellite fortress of the Black Star Army, but the size of the transportation door had already exceeded that of an armed satellite fortress. The radars of all the spaceships began ringing as they detected a large energy surge.</p>
<p>The next moment, a majestic castle covered in a colorful magical shield floated out from the transportation door. The complicated engravings on the spherical shield looked like exquisite decorations, and they shimmered as though they were breathing.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>The treasure of the Hidden Red Robe Abbey, Palace of Hidden Spells!</p>
<p>“Austin is here!”</p>
<p>“He actually brought his entire base over. He is truly too high profile.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Is he here as a spectator or to help one of the parties?”</p>
<p>Although the first Beyond Grade A to arrive was not involved in the battle, the spectators were still extremely excited. Since Austin had made his appearance, this meant that all five Beyond Grade A Supers in the Shattered Star Ring would gather there!</p>
<p>“This fellow is also here to join in the fun?” Ralph was startled and was worried that Austin would spoil his plans.</p>
<p>The commander of Bloodshed Land, Jorde, also felt nervous.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Austin is an enemy or ally…” Jorde gulped nervously. Psyker was the one who had contacted Austin in private, and thus, Jorde was not clear of Austin’s intentions.</p>
<p>The Palace of Hidden Spells very quickly completed its descent, and the transportation door shrank rapidly before disappearing with a flash of light. Austin’s main camp was a Beyond Grade A Universal Treasure Mage Pagoda, and he had engraved a large number of teleportation formations on the pagoda so that it could engage in long distance travel.</p>
<p>Numerous mages living in the Palace of Hidden Spells walked out of the castle and gathered together on one of the balconies to munch on snacks as they waited for the show to start. Austin then appeared on top of the castle with his Forbidden Sorcerer squad and controlled the Palace of Hidden Spells to find a good spot beside the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Tsk, why am I the first one here? Youngsters these days don’t have any sense of time,” Austin lamented.</p>
<p>He had rejected both parties’ requests to form an alliance and was there to watch the battle. In order to ensure that he could watch the show comfortably, he had even shifted his entire house.</p>
<p>Just when the spectators were discussing Austin’s intentions, a commotion broke out from afar.</p>
<div></div>
<p>A gigantic fleet approached the battlefield, and all the spectators who saw the insignia on the fleet could not help but make a path for them in shock.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>The insignia on the outside of the spaceship was one that everyone could recognize. It was the insignia of a Universal Civilization, the Arcane Church!</p>
<p>The Arcane Church had made an appearance as well!</p>
<p>This was a small portion of the fleet that the Arcane Church stationed in the Shattered Star Ring. The frigate was composed of a special Arcane Church model, which had a thin disc-like shape with the entire body covered in black and dark purple. Three gigantic empty holes could be seen on the body of the spaceship in a triangular formation with a dark-red energy ball floating in the middle of the holes. It served both as an energy furnace and annihilation weapon.</p>
<p>The flagship was of the butterfly model with a ball in the center and a few hundred butterfly wings connected on both sides. These wings were currently in their closed form and looked like a single pair of wings. Although the spaceship was made from metal, it was made from a special alloy and had a soft, silky texture. When the flagship entered battle, all the butterfly wings would open and slide along the surface of the ball in the middle to form a sun-like shape.</p>
<p>The Arcane Church fleet entered the battlefield without any obstruction, and a spaceship flew out from within the fleet. When the hatch of the spaceship opened, Psyker flew out from the spaceship. He was the second Beyond Grade A to arrive.</p>
<p>His body floated in front of the Arcane Church fleet, and his gaze was fixed on the Purple Crystal and Section Zero fleet far away. Despite being a tiny ant compared to the gigantic fleet, the attention of all the spectators was gathered on him.</p>
<p>Everyone took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Psyker has arrived!”</p>
<p>“The Arcane Church has actually sent a fleet with him. Is this the attitude of a Universal Civilization?”</p>
<div></div>
<p>It was no secret that the Arcane Church was behind the Star Pupil Holy Race, but the Universal Civilizations had not displayed an official stance with regards to this matter yet. For them to appear at this moment, it meant that they were about to interfere in the battle. This was something that all those present did not expect.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they were the spectators present or those watching the live broadcast, everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>They originally thought that this battle was only a conflict between Beyond Grade A Supers. However, the appearance of a Universal Civilization meant that the situation had become a lot more complex.</p>
<p>“Things aren’t looking good. The Arcane Church is here to help Psyker!” Ralph immediately felt as though a huge enemy had descended.</p>
<p>The fleet sent by the Arcane Church was extremely powerful and was comparable to the fleet of both Purple Crystal and Section Zero. Furthermore, how would Purple Crystal and Section Zero dare fight a Universal Civilization?</p>
<p>On the other side, Jorde became wary.</p>
<p>Because the Star Pupil Holy Race was too far away from the battlefield and could not send a fleet to support Psyker, everyone had thought that Psyker would come alone. However, the appearance of the Arcane Church meant that Psyker was the one with the most powerful backing out of everyone who is present. The special position of a Universal Civilization made all the organizations present tremble slightly.</p>
<p>However, before everyone could accept the changes before their eyes, another fleet descended.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the incoming fleet, everyone present was dumbfounded!</p>
<p>The Crimson Dynasty!</p>
<div></div>
<p>Yet another Universal Civilization‽</p>
<p>The technological skills of the Crimson Dynasty were obviously extremely different from those of the Arcane Church. The spaceships of the Arcane Church had a mystical and magical style while the spaceships of the Crimson Dynasty had a heavy industry style. The spaceship had a solid metal beauty and emanated a tyrannical pressure even from afar.</p>
<p>The Crimson Dynasty squeezed into the battlefield and stopped beside Klent, entering the face off with the Purple Crystal fleet as well. They looked as though they were there to support Tyrant.</p>
<p>Ten days prior, Zoel had agreed to Klent’s request for them to send a fleet to support the Tyrant. Upon seeing their backing arrive, Jorde immediately became relaxed, and he looked at the Black Star Army camp with a sneer.</p>
<p>Do you see that little brother? Do you have any backing?</p>
<p>We have two on our side!</p>
<p>On the Star Diamond Grade Flagship, Ralph’s face was completely pale, and he felt his legs turn to jelly.</p>
<p>He had never expected that things would turn out as such. The situation was not just bad at this moment. It was hopeless!</p>
<p>If both parties broke out in a conflict later, they would not be able to hold their own against two Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>Right at that moment, all the spectators finally snapped out of their stupor.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Both the Crimson Dynasty and Arcane Church have arrived!”</p>
<p>“Two Universal Civilizations are standing against Black Star‽”</p>
<p>“Black Star only has Purple Crystal behind him, and his situation truly looks pathetic…”</p>
<p>“A new Beyond Grade A Super actually has to face such a situation, huh? I think his luck just ran out.”</p>
<p>In the eyes of the spectators, both Universal Civilizations were going against Black Star together. The alliance of the Tyrant and Star Pupil was far too powerful, and Black Star was definitely on the losing side.</p>
<p>At the thought of Black Star’s predicament, cold sweat slid down the spectators’ backs. At the same time, the bets placed on the Tyrant rapidly surged up like mad. The various betting rings only planned to stop accepting bets after the arrival of Black Star and Heber but were forced to immediately stop accepting bets.</p>
<p>All the players in the Black Star Army camp could not help but feel anxious. This was the first time that they witnessed the peak characters of the universe, but they were all enemies of their faction.</p>
<p>“It seems like our Army Commander is in trouble…” Maple Moon clenched her fists tightly.</p>
<p>Frenzied Sword also could not help but worry, and his fists were clenched tightly as well.</p>
<p>Although the Black Star Army was the main camp in the hearts of the players, the brainwashing of the three versions had made all the players believe that the Universal Civilizations that had existed for a long time were the true tyrants of the galaxy. Originally, there were plenty of players who were optimistic about the battle, but the changes in the situation made it such that the players could not even force out a smile.</p>
<p>Many individuals could not help but be shaken. The next few versions would definitely revolve around the Universal Civilizations, but their Black Star Army had become an enemy of the Universal Civilizations. This was not a good sign at all…</p>
<p>On the contrary, Summer Night Flower was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The reason behind his inclination to the Bloodshed Land was because the Bloodshed Land would give them a path to join the Universal Civilizations. On the other hand, the Black Star Army only had the Purple Crystal Civilization above them. The appearance of the Crimson Dynasty was like an injection of confidence, and Summer Night Flower began to regain confidence in his belief.</p>
<p>“Do you see that? This is what I meant by a limited faction growth,” Summer Night Flower said with a face full of smiles. “I have emphasized this point since the start; we cannot be dazzled by the short term benefits placed before our eyes like the players of the Black Star Army. We should look far into the future and make the right choice instead.”</p>
<p>At the same time, many of the officers in the Black Star Army flagship had bitter looks on their faces.</p>
<p>Lagi then said with a sigh, “It seems like I will die here today…”</p>
<p>The other officers would usually tease Lagi about his pessimism, but no one replied that day.</p>
<p>Even they could not help but feel pessimistic.</p>
<p>They had not forgotten that their Army Commander had to face two different challenges!</p>
<p>Even if he could hold his own against the Tyrant, there was still a Psyker who wanted to force Black Star to give up the Evolution Cube. No matter what, they felt that it was better for Han Xiao to give in and take the initiative to hand over the Evolution Cube. There were two Universal Civilizations eyeing up the Evolution Cube, and their strength just could not hold a candle to Universal Civilizations.</p>
<p>They truly could not understand how their army could keep the Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>One of the Calamity Grade officers could not help but say, “Well, if he chooses to behave stubbornly…”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Sylvia glared at him hatefully, “Our job is to obey the orders of our commander. What do you want to say‽”</p>
<p>Everyone could not help but look at each other helplessly.</p>
<p>“Hopefully Black Star doesn’t lose his rationality…”</p>
<p>Right at this moment, a Bloodshed Land spaceship flew over from afar and came to the center of the battlefield. Heber had finally arrived.</p>
<p>He was equipped with a set of heavy armor and floated in the middle of the battlefield like a small mountain. All the spaceship’s radars began to ring after detecting his frightening energy.</p>
<p>Heber then turned around to glare at Psyker, warning Psyker not to interfere with his plans.</p>
<p>Psyker retreated a distance expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“The Tyrant is here as well. Only Black Star and the Dragon Emperor are left.”</p>
<p>“Eh, they’re here.”</p>
<p>All the spectators turned around to look, only to see a Black Star fleet arriving together with the Floating Dragon Island. Because the Floating Dragon Island could not travel at a high speed, Han Xiao and Ames were the last two to reach the battlefield.</p>
<p>The surrounding spaceships made a path for the humongous Floating Dragon to enter the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Everyone is finally here!”</p>
<p>The spectators’ excitement had reached the peak.</p>
<p>Ames floated up into the air, and Han Xiao also flew out from his spaceship, looking at Heber and Psyker from afar.</p>
<p>Han Xiao had filled the empty Mechanic slot, and the five Beyond Grade A Supers of the Shattered Star Ring were different classes. The spectators could not help but feel as though a ceremony was going on, and they were all witnessing this once in a lifetime ceremony.</p>
<p>Han Xiao turned around to look at Ames, and both of them nodded to each other. He then glanced at the huge crowd, and his face could not help but contort.</p>
<p>“Aren’t they afraid that I may accidentally kill a few lucky audience members?”</p>
<p>Han Xiao then looked at the Palace of Hidden Spells and shook his head helplessly. Finally, his gaze landed on Heber.</p>
<p>After sizing Heber up for a while, Han Xiao connected to the Tyrant’s communication device, and his voice sounded in Heber’s armor.</p>
<p>“I am here, Little Ty-Ty. How do you want to fight?”</p>
<p>“… What did you call me‽” Heber was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>“Heh, I will call you whatever I like.” Han Xiao chuckled.</p>
<p>Heber could not be bothered to reply and said, “Black Star, I’ve thought highly of you since over ten years ago. This proves that my foresight wasn’t wrong. It is a pity that you rejected my invitation and made the wrong decision. I gave you a chance before, but you didn’t know how to treasure it.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao curled his lips and said, “Don’t talk about such useless things. Don’t you want to make use of me to establish your prestige?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Heber did not bother hiding anything. “You are only alive today because you didn’t have any value for me to uproot before, and you really didn’t disappoint me. I let you keep your life until today so that I can use your fresh blood to paint my throne.”</p>
<p>At the Beyond Grade A level, one was only able to gain fame by killing another Beyond Grade A Super, and this had always been the Tyrant’s goal. In his eyes, as long as he could increase his prestige, more and more talents would come under him.</p>
<p>However, the other three Beyond Grade A Supers were not easy to deal with, and he did not have a reason to take action. Even Ames, who had her abilities countered by him, had impressive lifesaving abilities. Thus, he had decided to rear up a Beyond Grade A enemy and get rid of the fellow before he could grow up fully.</p>
<p>Han Xiao was the target whom he had chosen.</p>
<p>Upon hearing those words, Han Xiao couldn’t help but shake his head.</p>
<p>Since you like rearing pigs so much, you’d better be careful not to get squashed by the pig.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, Han Xiao’s interface lit up.</p>

<p>_____________________</p>
<p>“To think that it is actually such a mission.” Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>A Beyond Grade A Super was a true boss and an unscalable mountain. Even if the players had his current level, they would not be able to defeat a Beyond Grade A Super with a body full of Molding Talents. The only difference was the amount of time they could last. In his previous life, there were some players who had challenged Beyond Grade A Supers, and a portion of them triggered special S rank missions like this one. It had given them rewards based on the amount of time they could survive.</p>
<p>In his previous life, it was incredibly difficult for most of the players to last even a minute. The only method they had was to leave combat mode and escape to the best of their abilities. Because only one percent of the time was calculated, this meant that only eighteen seconds would be counted toward the mission at the very most. If the players wanted to earn the reward for lasting twenty minutes, they would have to leave combat mode more than sixty times at least. Furthermore, they had to ensure that the Beyond Grade A Super would not catch up to them for thirty mins. This meant that they needed to escape from the Beyond Grade A Super for more than thirty hours. It was a mission that was almost impossible to complete.</p>
<p>Han Xiao had challenged a Beyond Grade A Super before, and his best record was only a few minutes.</p>
<p>However, the interface’s judgement of a mission rating was on the basis of the player’s strength, and Han Xiao was an exception.</p>
<p>He did not need to leave combat mode and could choose to fight head on!</p>
<p>With his endurance, twenty mins would only be a warm up!</p>
<p>Han Xiao let out a deep breath, and his bluish-gold Mechanical Force burst forth.</p>
<p>Behind him, a large mechanical army appeared, forming an endless wave of black!</p>
<p>Emperor Mechanic! Secondary Dimension Army!</p>
<p>Upon seeing that, Heber cracked his neck, and his body exploded with a ball of fire.</p>
<p>The next moment, the mechanical army welcomed a shooting-star-like figure.</p>

				<h3>Chapter 964 Theme of the Era</h3>
<p>With many financial groups coming up with the resources for construction, the originally silent Flickering World was bustling with activity.</p>
<p>The three explored Star Clusters were all undergoing construction, and the silent Flickering World finally seemed more like a part of the interstellar era.</p>
<p>Han Xiao’s fleet entered the Flickering World through the dynasty’s stargate. The various officers were all extremely familiar with him, and he did not face any obstruction along the way.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>Upon reaching the Planet Lighthouse outpost, Han Xiao greeted Tarrokov and extorted Tarrokov of some local produce before leaving toward the Garu Star Cluster.</p>
<p>The Purple River Star System was located at the border of the Garu Star Cluster, near where the stargate was located. It was now Han Xiao’s territory. Thus, the dynasty had built a new stargate beside the original one for the Black Star Army to manage.</p>
<p>After entering the Purple River Star System, they followed the directions on the star map and arrived at a planet.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Army Commander, that is Planet Black Gate, the planet nearest to the stargate. According to the construction blueprint, this planet will be developed into a large transit station and become one of the landmarks of the Garu Star Cluster. This is also the planet at the border of the army’s territory.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao stood in front of the window and looked at the planet. Beside him was a beautiful secretary giving Han Xiao an introduction.</p>
<p>Sylvia was busy, so she had sent one of her secretaries over to accompany Han Xiao. Han Xiao had some impression of this secretary. He remembered that her resume was pretty outstanding, and she was Sylvia’s capable assistant.</p>
<p>“How is the construction coming along?” Han Xiao nodded.</p>
<p>“This planet made use of the Crimson Dynasty’s quick planetary renovation pack, and the logistics department drew up a blueprint after that. The direction of the construction is toward a galactic market, military fortress, and transportation hub. Because the main focus of the construction is the resource rich planets, only 4.9% of the construction has been completed. The daily energy requirements are provided by a nuclear fusion power station, and our dark energy power station is located underground. However, there isn’t a natural Fixed Star in the vicinity, so we may need additional power sources and a manmade sun…”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Hearing the secretary’s report, Han Xiao suddenly thought about the movable Fixed Star blueprint in the Tyracles legacy.</p>
<p>The more advanced their technological skills, the fewer restrictions the environment would impose on them. They no longer needed to adapt to the environment but could get the environment to change to their needs.</p>
<p>Although the Tyracles Race was not a victor of the exploration era, they were also a quasi-Universal Civilization and had a deep understanding of modifying the environment.</p>
<p>I can make use of the movable Fixed Star equipment and shift the Fixed Star to an appropriate location, Han Xiao thought to himself.</p>
<p>He had always felt that this blueprint had a relationship to the [Universal Simulation] skill of the Divine Throne Mechanic.</p>
<p>After his Class Advancement, Han Xiao had researched all his new abilities but was completely clueless toward how he should use [Universal Simulation]. This skill allowed him to simulate all natural rhythms through his mechanical skills and should have huge potential.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the three Universal Civilizations had made use of [Universal Simulation] to modify their mother planets.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Xiao remain silent, the female secretary paused for a while before continuing. “There aren’t many people on Planet Black Gate currently, but Planet Black Gate will become one of the most populated planets in the Garu Star Cluster when the Flickering World is opened to the public. The large number of daily visitors will bring you a considerable amount of profits. According to the calculations of the financial department, we only need six to seven years to recoup our cost of modifying the planet.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty good.” Han Xiao smiled.</p>
<p>The fleet slowly approached Planet Black Gate, and a few stargates were shown on the map. There were some heading toward the other Star Systems and some heading toward the other regions of the Purple River Star System.</p>
<p>Because the allocation of their territories had been decided, the Black Star Army’s first mission was to connect their seven territories.</p>
<p>During the exploration phase, the entire Star Cluster already had their own transportation network. However, those were long distance stargates mainly used to connect different Star Clusters. The Black Star Army’s mission was to connect their own territories and ensure that the seven Star Systems were well connected.</p>
<p>The transportation network within the territory had already taken on an embryonic form, and many different Star Systems could be reached from Planet Black Gate. Their efficiency was far higher than the first exploration phase.</p>
<div></div>
<p>With a robust transportation network, they could save a lot of time on travelling. Han Xiao led his fleet to tour through the seven Star Systems and viewed all the construction regions.</p>
<p>This was the first time that he personally inspected his territories.</p>
<p>“Purple River, Long Day, Sigma, Odoran, Ponzale, Fenrir, Ednea… This is the current foundation of the army.”</p>
<p>Personally witnessing the size of the seven Star Systems, Han Xiao was extremely satisfied in his heart.</p>
<p>He planned to make the seven Star Systems into the core region of the Garu Star Cluster, but this would require a few decades to accomplish. However, the second phase of the [Flickering World] mission only required him to complete the basic construction of the seven Star Systems. To complete the basic construction of the seven Star Systems, a few years would be sufficient. With the investment of numerous financial groups, the production capability of the army was powerful.</p>
<p>After completing his inspection, Han Xiao returned to the Sigma Star System, which was located in the middle of Garu, to check on the development of the machinery civilization.</p>
<p>Han Xiao’s fleet exited from hyperdrive, and a silver planet appeared before him. Machinery melded into the surface of the planet, and it looked extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>This was the first city of the machinery civilization, and it was called Psionic Prime City!</p>
<p>The surface of the planet had been modified to become machinery. Under the surface of the earth were many different underground mines to extract for various resources.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Under the lead of Psionic Prime and the other Apostle Weapons, military factories, repair factories, resource factories, refinement factories, and many other facilities were constructed. At the same time, there were millions of second-generation mechanical life forms currently waiting to be born.</p>
<p>In the middle of the city, there was a gigantic statue of him.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that, Han Xiao was helpless.</p>
<p>For some reason, people always seem to like erecting statues. What’s the point of erecting a statue of me? Why not erect a statue of Feidin instead? That statue might be able to provide some luck for you.</p>
<p>For a mechanical life form to create offspring, it would require them to exhaust their own tinder energy and reproduction had a cooldown. Thus, the larger the size of the machinery civilization, the faster the growth.</p>
<p>The [Mechanical Proliferation Growth] and [Strengthened Machinery Civilization] talents from the Divine Throne Mechanic class could strengthen the reproductive capabilities of the mechanical life form. Han Xiao was planning to spend some time on this planet to create a few more first-generation Mechanical Lives.</p>
<p>The machinery civilization led by Psionic Prime had just started out, and their population was lacking. However, they had plenty of variety with various types of mechanical life forms working in their own posts.</p>
<p>Not too far away from the city, Giant King Kong was leading a group of Giant Soldiers to flatten a tall mountain.</p>
<p>Without disturbing anyone else, Han Xiao contacted Psionic Prime.</p>
<p>Very quickly, a blue light shot out of the planet and arrived before the fleet.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“I pay my respects to the Lord.” Psionic Prime bowed.</p>
<p>The hatch opened, and Han Xiao flew out. Sizing Psionic Prime up, Han Xiao raised his brows slightly.</p>
<p>Compared to the last time they met, Psionic Prime had a few new parts on him. These parts were chosen by Psionic Prime himself to make up for some of his weaknesses.</p>
<p>This was the good point of a mechanical life form; they knew how to change their own parts to strengthen themselves.</p>
<p>“You’ve done well. Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao praised him and released a stream of bluish-gold Mechanical Force from his palms.</p>
<p>“Treat this as your reward.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao then slapped the Mechanical Force into Psionic Prime’s body. This was the [Apostle Evolution] skill from his Divine Throne Mechanic class.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Psionic Prime’s body glowed with energy, and the tinder energy in his body strengthened.</p>
<p>Han Xiao watched by the side, and Psionic Prime’s evolution process ended after a while.</p>
<p>Detecting the changes in his body, Psionic Prime nodded to Han Xiao.</p>
<p>“I thank the Lord for your blessing. My strength has increased again.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t a need to thank me. This is something you deserve. You just need to do your job well.”</p>
<p>Han Xiao waved his arms and opened his interface. Psionic Prime’s attributes were all increased by [Apostle Evolution].</p>
<p>His Apostle Weapons had quasi-Beyond Grade A strength, and after the [Apostle Evolution], they would be able to hold their own against an ordinary Beyond Grade A Super.</p>
<p>According to Han Xiao’s calculations, the current Psionic Prime should be able to defeat an ordinary doppelganger of EsGod before his evolution, providing that the doppelganger did not have a perverse Esper Ability.</p>
<p>Sending Psionic Prime back, Han Xiao made a trip over to the territory of the Black Spirit Race.</p>
<p>Compared to the rapid development of the machinery civilization, the Black Spirit Race seemed much more ordinary.</p>
<p>Although they had an extremely efficient communication method, they still needed time to learn and were digesting the basic technological knowledge that the army had provided them.</p>
<p>This technological knowledge was too complicated for them, and they had to start their learning from scratch.</p>
<p>Their mental network system would only show its effectiveness if they had a strong foundation.</p>
<p>As long as they took the first step, the development speed of the Black Spirit Race would increase rapidly. They would be able to rapidly go through the stone age era, cold arms era, enlightenment era, steam engine era, electricity era, and so on, soon arriving at the interstellar era.</p>
<p>Apart from their survival, the greatest barrier of a civilization was technological and production advancement. They needed to spend a great amount of time fumbling around in the dark. But with the interference of the Black Star Army, all of that would not be a problem. Their greatest problems would be solved, and their development definitely would not be slow.</p>
<p>Han Xiao provided the relevant technological trees to the Black Spirit Race and also the methods to expand their mental strength.</p>
<p>The Black Spirit Race, which had a mental network, innately had a high natural potential. They were most suitable to become Psychics or Mages, and it might be possible for more than ninety percent of them to become Supers.</p>
<p>Of course, he would not reject any of them if they wanted to become Mechanics.</p>
<p>It was not without reason for the three Universal Civilizations to prohibit advanced civilizations from interfering with the development of low-grade civilizations. If they followed the path that someone else had taken, they would only become the puppet of another civilization, and their own creativity would be restricted.</p>
<p>With regard to this, Han Xiao did not really have a plan. It was impossible for him not to pay the price if he wanted rapid development. However, the Evolutionary Totem could resolve this problem to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The Evolutionary Totem was able to gradually evolve the genes of a race and increase the potential of a race, including their intelligence and creativity. With the effects of the Evolutionary Totem, it might be possible for an individual capable of changing history to appear from the Black Spirit Race.</p>
<p>Although a civilization was an entire body, many historical events were usually created by individuals. The presence of the Evolutionary Totem increased the chances for such an individual to appear.</p>
<p>Allowing a species to become more outstanding was the meaning of the Evolutionary Totem. This was not a perfect solution, and there was a reality of despair deep within.</p>
<p>For example, what if a new species that did not conform to the norms of society appeared on a planet ruled by humans? Imagine if this beast was not only stronger but also more intelligent and superior to the human race in every respect. At that time, the humans would no longer be the rulers of the planet, and the technology that they had relied on for many years would be overtaken eventually…</p>
<p>It was far more outstanding than them.</p>
<p>At that time, choosing whether to live together with the new species or kill them would be a tough choice.</p>
<p>Suppressing such a new species would always be filled with blood.</p>
<p>This was the most terrifying part of the Evolutionary Totem and also why the Federation of Light and Arcane Church were not able to watch as the Crimson Dynasty swallowed all the benefits of the Evolutionary Totem for themselves. However, the Universal Civilizations had their own gene modification technology and were thus able to control the desire for battle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Xiao borrowed the effects from the battle with Manison to remain low profile and not cause trouble everywhere. He then followed his plan to expand his mechanical army and reinforce his foundation.</p>
<p>This was a path that all Mechanics had to take.</p>
<p>After Manison achieved victory, he also did not do anything else. He returned to the Primeval Star River and did not provoke the Black Star Army again.</p>
<p>With both parties falling silent, the various galactic organizations no longer paid close attention to this matter and shifted their gazes away from Han Xiao.</p>
<p>The first exploration phase had been completed and the Flickering World was currently in the construction phase. Many organizations were watching silently from the side, and the explored universe had entered a calm period.</p>
<p>Although there were still small skirmishes occasionally, there were no large conflicts between the civilizations of the Star Cluster grade and above. It was as though they had a tacit agreement and chose to rest.</p>
<p>The Federation of Light and Arcane Church continued to pressure the Crimson Dynasty in the economic and political fields. Although they had plenty of conflicts, the situation was still under control.</p>
<p>The Crimson Dynasty was under quite a bit of pressure and was still holding in there. There were also voices within the dynasty that were calling for the open sale of the totems, but the voices were still weak.</p>
<p>If a new theme would be created for this era, it would be called ‘exploration and expansion’.</p>
<p>This was not only the development of a single civilization but a new Star Field being absorbed into the map of the explored universe. It was akin to discovering a new continent, and it was enough to change the situation of the entire universe.</p>
<p>Under the influence of such an atmosphere, even the Beyond Grade As chose to remain silent. The battle between Han Xiao and the Mechanic Emperor became the last battle between Beyond Grade As for a long time.</p>
<p>Time then crept slowly in the peace.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Galaxy Calendar: Year 716, 17th day of the 1st month.</p>
<p>The blue stargate at Planet Black Gate began glowing, and a middle-sized spaceship was spat out from the center of the stargate.</p>
<p>In the spaceship, a group of youths were standing in front of the window and looking at Planet Black Gate with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Is this the territory of the Black Star Army? We’re finally here!”</p>
<p>“I heard that Black Star has remained in the Flickering World for the past few years. It has been five years since we last heard news about him.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Do you think we will be able to see Black Star in person?”</p>
<p>“I wonder if he will be like principal Lagi…”</p>
<p>“Shut up! Don’t mention that taboo name!”</p>
<p>Someone grabbed his head and collapsed as though he was having fits.</p>
<p>“Argh! Come and give me a hand! His PTSD syndrome is acting up again!”</p>
<p>The people in the surroundings looked at this pitiful brother of theirs who was suffering from ‘Lagi PTSD’ syndrome.</p>
<p>“Sigh, another one has fallen.”</p>
<p>One of the youths who was about 1.7m tall could not help but laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>“This is too exaggerated. I don’t really think the principal is that scary…”</p>
<p>A young lady who was half a head taller than him rolled her eyes. “Of course you are alright. Why don’t you think about the mental damage that is done to those with poor results?”</p>
<p>The young man then rubbed his head and muttered, “Really? I thought that everyone liked the principal a lot…”</p>
<p>This young man was about sixteen to seventeen years old but looked extremely child-like. He looked like a primary school kid that had not grown up yet and was dressed in the Black Star Army uniform.</p>
<p>The beautiful young lady beside him had a smoking hot figure and was dressed in skintight Pugilist clothing. She looked extremely close to this young man.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, the captain walked over and patted the young man on the shoulders.</p>
<p>“The defense troops are sending a communication request. You can just pick up the call to save us some trouble.”</p>
<p>The young man nodded and pressed a few buttons on the wall of the spaceship. A holographic projection then appeared, and the guard commander of the Black Star Army appeared.</p>
<p>“Which department are you guys from? Why didn’t I receive an application from the army?”</p>
<p>If not for the Black Star insignia on the spaceship, the commander might have given the order to capture the spaceship already.</p>
<p>“We are the first batch of graduates from the Black Star Super Academy. According to the rules of the academy, the graduates can choose to join the training camp and serve the Black Star Army for two to three years. We are here to find a job with the army. It must have been a slip up for you to not be informed.”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Let me check.” The commander frowned and searched through his records for a while before saying, “Mmm, there was a special request indeed, but you guys came too late and have long exceeded the appointed time.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. This was our first time coming to the Flickering World, and we explored a few different places first. Thus, our journey may have been delayed. You can check the records of the spaceship.”</p>
<p>The commander then ran some checks before nodding. “Hmm, the checks on the spaceship are alright. You guys can come in.”</p>
<p>“Alright, thanks… Right, can you not tell the Army Commander that I am here?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, the commander had a strange look on his face.</p>
<p>Just what kind of a background did this youth have?</p>
<p>He then sized up the young man and felt that he was extremely familiar.</p>
<p>“Who are you? What is your relationship with the Army Commander?”</p>
<p>“I am Nero. Black Star is my godfather.” Nero chuckled and a bright smile could be seen on his face. “I am here to give him a surprise!”</p>

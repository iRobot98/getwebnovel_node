				<p><strong>848 Appearance of the Spacetime Amber!</strong></p>
<p>A few minutes earlier…</p>
<p>In the skies of Planet Lighthouse, the seven Beyond Grade As were tangled up in an intense battle. Fire and water collided, magic and psychic energy tangled with each other, and machines collided with flesh.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>With a three-on-four situation, the enemy had no choice but to slow their attacks. With the pressure on Han Xiao easing significantly, Han Xiao gradually gained his footing with his powerful recovery ability.</p>
<p>Han Xiao&#8217;s mechanical army, Austin&#8217;s Palace of Hidden Spells, Taylor&#8217;s summoned creatures, Psyker&#8217;s psychic energy, Dylan&#8217;s control of water, Beyoni&#8217;s flames… Various attacks filled the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>The most powerful area of effect abilities still came from the mechanical army. With over ten million soldiers, the psionic cannon fire covered almost every inch of sky. The boost from [Perfect Mechanical Sense] and True Damage from [Legendary Battle Technique] made it such that Psyker&#8217;s group of four did not dare lower their guard.</p>
<p>Even a Beyond Grade A would not be able to emerge unscathed from such a battle. The summoned creatures and mechanical army that adopted Human Wave Tactics suffered huge casualties.</p>
<p>The mechanical army could be repaired, and the summoned creatures could be summoned without end. Both parties had their own advantages.</p>
<p>If they were fighting a one-on-one battle, Han Xiao would probably have been able to defeat Taylor without using [Perfect Mechanical Sense]. With the boost from the Perfect Mechanical Sense, he would be able to stably defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>However, Taylor had his teammates to tie down Han Xiao&#8217;s mechanical army and to allow him to summon his summoned creatures more easily to call upon a never-ending supply of helpers.</p>
<p>There were many different summoned creatures of various shapes and forms. There were demonic bats, turquoise statues, plasma snakes, spirit hunters, ghost scepters, and so on. Their combat abilities varied, and they were the beasts that had been groomed by Taylor after signing a contract with him. A powerful Summoner would definitely have a large variety of summoned creatures.</p>
<p>Han Xiao split up three million mechanical soldiers for his AI to control just to deal with these summoned creatures.</p>
<p>The battle between the mechanical army and summoned creatures was like a war between two armies. The mechanical army had extremely good teamwork and could accurately snipe wave after wave of summoned creatures. Thus, their casualties were lower than the summoned creatures.</p>
<p>In the chaotic battlefield, a Mechanical Life squad under Psionic Prime&#8217;s lead weaved throughout the heavy fire.</p>
<p>The combat artificial intelligence, Sparta, did not take over the body of the Mechanical Lives but was only in charge of issuing strategic commands.</p>
<p>A powerful data processing speed together with the battlefield module displayed the gaps in the rain of bullets and showed the best way to avoid all the bullets. Psionic Prime then followed the predetermined path with his entire team behind him and avoided all the incoming energy beams, blocking all those that could not be dodged with a psionic shield.</p>
<p>The destination of the squad was a group of elite summoned creatures.</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>Their target was a team of powerful leader-grade demonic bats that were guarding a group of turquoise statues that were firing laser beams. They were all being boosted by the Summoner and had their attributes increased greatly. Plenty of ordinary mechanical soldiers had already been destroyed by them.</p>
<p>&#8220;All forces, take note. Our mission is to wipe out the enemy&#8217;s elites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Psionic Prime&#8217;s emotionless voice sounded in the communication channel.</p>
<p>These demonic bats discovered the rapidly approaching Mechanical Life squad and immediately went forward to intercept them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distance between the target is shrinking. Get ready for battle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Target locked on. Open fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mechanical Life that belonged to the long-distance attacking squad reverted to their original forms. There were dark energy artillery towers, psionic jet cannons, firepower forts, high energy short range guided missiles, and many other models. They let out a series of long-range attacks.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The leader grade demonic bats opened their demonic shields and charged forward while enduring fire. From time to time, some of their shields would be broken, and they would succumb to the firepower of the mechanical soldiers.</p>
<p>Facing a wave of attacks, the gigantic turquoise statues also turned around with their eyes charging up with white energy. The next moment, a thick magical beam shot out of their eyes and destroyed all the mechanical soldiers and summoned creatures in the way of their target.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giant King Kong, attack!&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind Psionic Prime, a gigantic shadow descended, and a Giant Soldier that was a few hundred meters tall appeared. It was called Giant King Kong.</p>
<p>Giant King Kong held up a huge psionic shield to protect the members of the team and block all the magical beams.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A huge explosion erupted by Giant King Kong only suffered from some external damage.</p>
<p>The thrusters behind Giant King Kong then blasted out at full power, and the gigantic figure crashed into the incoming summoned creatures before landing beside the turquoise statues. Both gigantic figures clashed with each other!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>It was as though the mountains were shaking!</p>
<p>The turquoise statues suffered from a flurry of punches and turquoise fragments flew in all directions. With both the gigantic creatures engaging in battle, the smaller troops had also begun an intense battle.</p>
<p>These Mechanical Lives were all elites and had grown for a long period of time. There were some of them who were like mini bosses, and their combat capabilities were exceptional. This was Han Xiao&#8217;s most powerful elite troop.</p>
<p>The armed cavalry, Oathkeeper, beastman warriors, and various other different models of Mechanical Life charged forward in unison. It was a complete one-sided massacre of the summoned creatures.</p>
<p>The spirit hunters that joined the battle were also easily taken care of by the Mechanical Life squad.</p>
<p>Psionic Prime&#8217;s body was reconstructed many times, and he had easily reduced the demonic bats into piles of meat. He then looked around and realized that his teammates had all finished their battles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph, easy.&#8221; Silver Flash released the corpse of a demonic bat. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity that we are fighting a defensive war. If I could attack, I would be able to unleash all my firepower, and the battle would have been over already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop bragging!&#8221; Scarlet Flame said.</p>
<p>Silver Flash ignored him and looked toward the battlefield of the seven Beyond Grade As. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity we aren&#8217;t strong enough. I really wish to help father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father is protecting us,&#8221; Giant King Kong replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the weapons that father created, but he is protecting us. Is this the fatherly love that those living creatures possess?&#8221; Silver Flash asked curiously.</p>
<p>Psionic Prime was about to reply, but a large whooshing sound could suddenly be heard from the sky.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>All the Mechanical Lives looked up.</p>
<p>A gigantic dragon was descending rapidly from outside the atmosphere with dragon blood raining down like a thunderstorm. The dragon&#8217;s body was burning like a meteor, and it crashed through a wave of mechanical soldiers and summoned creatures.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The gigantic dragon crash landed on the planet like an atomic bomb with a loud mushroom-shaped dust cloud being formed in the sky!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that Milizaus who fell from the sky? He is severely wounded‽&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao, Beyoni, and Austin were shocked upon witnessing such a scene.</p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be the case! Milizaus&#8217; strength is sufficient to deal with Sagman and Ninjia, and he shouldn&#8217;t have been defeated so quickly and with such severe injuries!</p>
<p>The three of them were full of shock and edged toward Milizaus&#8217; position, dragging the battle to the ground. Psyker&#8217;s group of four followed closely behind.</p>
<p>The next moment, Han Xiao and Beyoni landed beside the gigantic crater, and Austin controlled the Palace of Hidden Spells to float in midair. Upon looking at Milizaus&#8217; present state, the three of them were shocked.</p>
<p>Milizaus&#8217; gigantic dragon body was in an extremely pathetic state. A huge hole had opened up in his chest, and his fractured bones and innards could be seen.</p>
<p>This frightening injury seemed to have been inflicted in a single attack, and Beyoni was truly shocked. He could not imagine just what kind of a frightening attack would be able to cause such damage to Milizaus&#8217; robust body.</p>
<p>These were not his only injuries. New cracks can be seen on Milizaus&#8217; body as though there was a sort of energy continuing to cause damage to his body and destroying his cells.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that, Han Xiao took out a syringe from his mechanical suit and injected Milizaus with Aurora&#8217;s life potion. However, it only slowed down the worsening of Milizaus&#8217; injuries; he still showed no signs of recovery.</p>
<p>Because Han Xiao injected the wound, a notification popped up on his interface.</p>
<p>The interface showed Milizaus&#8217; present situation. His health was currently at sixty-three, and it was still falling. There were a few negative statuses on Milizaus, with two of them being the most frightening.</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>[Cell Activity Inhibition &#8211; High]: All recovery methods will have their effects reduced by 70% (From Ninjia).</p>
<p>[Double Corrosion]: Suffer 12,582 physical damage and 15,733 mental damage every second (From Ninjia).</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh…&#8221; Milizaus let out a groan and said to Han Xiao&#8217;s group of three weakly, &#8220;Be careful. They brought the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could finish, Sagman and Ninjia descended, and the six enemies Beyond Grade As were gathered!</p>
<p>Han Xiao raised his head and immediately saw the weapon that had injured Milizaus. It was the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter that was floating beside Sagman.</p>
<p>To think that it would be this infamous Universal Treasure… Han Xiao&#8217;s expression sank.</p>
<p>The Arcane Church had truly gone all out this time!</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve even brought this item out?&#8221; Austin&#8217;s expression changed greatly and immediately thought of escaping.</p>
<p>He had already fulfilled his promise and felt that he had done all he could. He did not want to die there because of a promise. It was because of his Palace of Hidden Spells&#8217; defense and mobility that he dared participate in such an imbalanced battle. However, the attack of the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter was extremely queer, and it was capable of ignoring most physical defenses and shields. The attack could only be avoided but not blocked, which meant that the Palace of Hidden Spells would not be able to help him block the attack.</p>
<p>Austin&#8217;s thoughts were extremely clear. The Arcane Church&#8217;s targets were Black Star and the dynasty. Since he was not the enemy&#8217;s target, the enemy definitely would not waste their Beyond Grade A combatants to chase him if he wanted to escape.</p>
<p>He did not want to experience the feeling of a weapon that could threaten a Beyond Grade A.</p>
<p>This darn old man is thinking of escaping…</p>
<p>Although he did not know how to read minds, Han Xiao knew what Austin was thinking upon seeing his look of hesitation.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter was out of his expectations. If he had known that the enemy had such a trump card, he would not have allowed Milizaus to separate from them.</p>
<p>Han Xiao had a solemn expression and injected Milizaus a few more times. Only then did his injuries stop worsening with signs of recovery.</p>
<p>[Cell Activity Inhibition &#8211; High] only weakened the effect of Aurora&#8217;s life potion, but with a large stock in his possession, Han Xiao only needed to give a few more injections for the same effect. It was just that the recovery time needed would be longer.</p>
<p>However, the six Beyond Grade A enemies definitely would not give them so much time.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The six of them floated in midair and looked down at Milizaus, Beyoni, and Han Xiao. A shocking pressure descended from the sky, but Austin was actually blocked out by their pressure.</p>
<p>Psyker looked at Austin and said, &#8220;Stop interfering with us. This is the final warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221; Austin looked at Han Xiao and twitched his lips, not daring to make another move.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Deity Scepter then floated in front of Sagman and aimed at the immobilized Milizaus.</p>
<p>A look of despair could be seen in Milizaus&#8217; eyes. He was extremely clear about his current situation. Although Han Xiao had managed to help him recover with some magical potion, he would definitely be driven to the brink of death if he took another attack.</p>
<p>Just as Sagman was about to activate the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter, Han Xiao took a deep breath and said loudly, &#8220;Do you guys want the Evolution Cube‽&#8221;</p>
<p>Sagman stopped moving and narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to hand it over in exchange for a chance to survive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221; Han Xiao let out a deep breath and deactivated the Spacetime Amber sealing effect.</p>
<p>The six of them then looked at the silver cube in Han Xiao&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Right then, Psyker&#8217;s psychic connection to the Evolution Cube was restored, and he said with confirmation, &#8220;It&#8217;s the real deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sagman nodded upon hearing that and said to Han Xiao.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you even have the right to negotiate? We can still get the Evolution Cube if we kill you. Why do we have to agree to your demands? The choice to kill or capture you is in our hands. Do you even have the right to choose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are wrong.&#8221; Han Xiao tightened his grip on the Evolution Cube. &#8220;If I destroy the outer covering of the Evolution Cube and release its gigantic main body… Haha, do you think that you can take it away before the dynasty&#8217;s reinforcements arrive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sagman&#8217;s eyes narrowed, but he was not too surprised by those words.</p>
<p>Before they took action, the Arcane Church had already guessed that Black Star may choose to destroy the outer covering of the Evolution Cube and had already made preparations.</p>
<p>EsGod&#8217;s chips for negotiating with the Arcane Church were information on the Evolutionary Civilization and the apparatus to allow the Evolution Cube to be carried around. However, EsGod would only provide information on the apparatus after their deal was completed.</p>
<p>Thus, it would save them a great deal of trouble if Black Star was willing to hand over the portable Evolution Cube.</p>
<p>With the authority to determine Han Xiao&#8217;s life and death, Sagman said with an aloof attitude, &#8220;Alright, I won&#8217;t kill all of you if you hand over the Evolution Cube and surrender. The upper echelons will definitely be interested in seeing the dynasty pay a hefty price in exchange for all of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was the representative among the six and had the authority to make decisions on the ground. Capturing them was better than killing them. Although it would still anger the dynasty, they would have more chips to bargain with the dynasty.</p>
<p>Although Milizaus was frustrated about the crisis that Han Xiao had brought to him, he could not help but feel a sense of desolation in his heart upon seeing Han Xiao take out the Evolution Cube to save their lives.</p>
<p>At this moment, he suddenly felt Han Xiao stepping on him secretly and knew that Han Xiao had a plan. Thus, he connected the three of their minds with magic.</p>
<p>Han Xiao then heaved a sigh of relief and said, &#8220;As proof of my sincerity, I shall tell you the secret password to activate the portable Evolution Cube.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he said those words, he didn&#8217;t wait for Sagman&#8217;s response and quickly activated the sequence.</p>
<p>There was indeed a special method required to activate the Evolution Cube, and Han Xiao&#8217;s words were not wrong. Showing it to them on the spot would prevent them from being fooled by EsGod&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? You&#8217;ll have more than enough time to show us after you become a captive…&#8221; Sagman did not realize anything at the start and only frowned. However, he immediately noticed something and roared, &#8220;No! Stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao ignored those words and completed the sequence.</p>
<p>Hu!</p>
<p>The next moment, he activated the evolution energy within the cube and sent it toward the six in the sky.</p>
<p>The six of them immediately raised their shields. If they were struck by the evolution energy, they would become a black cocoon and start the evolution process. Although they could forcefully stop the process and recover their movement, they would still be restricted for some time.</p>
<p>Sagman&#8217;s murderous intent toward Han Xiao immediately exploded.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know how to treasure the opportunity that I have given you and tried to ambush us!</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Sagman activated the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter and aimed it at Milizaus. After killing Milizaus, they would have more than enough time to slowly torture Black Star!</p>
<p>Ohm!</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Deity Scepter shot out an energy pillar.</p>
<p>Milizaus thought about Han Xiao&#8217;s words and could only choose to trust Han Xiao. He then ignored the attack from the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter and unleashed his magical attacks at Sagman&#8217;s group of six.</p>
<p>Beyoni also did the same thing and unleashed his attacks to restrain them.</p>
<p>The mechanical army also received the order to open fire!</p>
<p>On the other side, Han Xiao released a few machinery balls, which floated in the path of the energy pillar. The machinery balls formed two layers of barriers in front of him.</p>
<p>Following which, these machinery balls underwent nano transformation and revealed a half transparent amber ball within them.</p>
<p>After spending half a month on Planet Lighthouse, Han Xiao had already made use of the Spacetime Amber to craft plenty of amber balls!</p>
<p>The six from the Arcane Church retreated to avoid the evolution energy while dealing with the attacks from Han Xiao&#8217;s group of three.</p>
<p>Looking at this scene, a mocking look could be seen on Sagman&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;A shield? A shield is completely useless… what‽&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence, the scene before their eyes shocked the six of them.</p>
<p>The energy pillar of the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter did not go through the half transparent spherical shaped shield but shot in all other directions like a pillar of water landing on a lotus leaf. Not a single bit went through!</p>
<p>Milizaus and Beyoni also had looks of disbelief on their faces. Han Xiao had previously said that he would be able to block the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter, and they could only choose to believe him. Upon seeing Han Xiao&#8217;s success, they could not help but be stunned.</p>
<p>The reason Han Xiao was so certain was not because of blind confidence in the Spacetime Amber. In his previous life, during the World Tree Civilization war, the Arcane Church had used the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter, which failed because of the Spacetime Amber!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just when the enemy was in shock, Han Xiao, who already knew that the Spacetime Amber would be able to stop the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter, scattered the amber ball shields and shot them toward the enemy.</p>
<p>Sagman&#8217;s group of six had already snapped out of their shock and wanted to retrieve the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter.</p>
<p>However, the scattered amber balls disrupted all the enemy&#8217;s psychic, magic, and light attacks!</p>
<p>The six of them could not imagine that these half transparent shields were capable of blocking all their attacks without being damaged in the slightest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what is this strange item? It is actually able to stop all attacks‽&#8221;</p>
<p>Just when they discovered that, despite physical attacks being useless against these amber balls, they were still able to send the amber balls flying through the force of their attacks, it was far too late!</p>
<p>Han Xiao activated his Void Hyperdrive and held onto the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter before charging into the air!</p>
<p>With the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter being snatched, Sagman&#8217;s group of six abandoned the others without any hesitation and gave chase to Han Xiao.</p>
<p>With one running and six chasing, the six of them caught up in less than a minute.</p>
<p>The combined attacks of six Beyond Grade A was not something that he could block, and he was sent flying helplessly.</p>
<p>His health fell rapidly, and Han Xiao threw the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter away.</p>
<p>Sagman immediately stretched his hands out to catch the scepter and snatch it back.</p>
<p>But before he could even heave a sigh of relief, he realized that the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter was sealed into a half transparent spherical ball.</p>
<p>Energy was not capable of passing through the ball, and the shape of the ball was the same as those shields that blocked the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter!</p>
<p>Sagman&#8217;s expression changed greatly!</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what did you do‽&#8221;</p>

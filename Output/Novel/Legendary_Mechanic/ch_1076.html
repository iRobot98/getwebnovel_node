				<h1 class="chapter-title">1076 An Organization That Should Not Have Appeared in This Era</h1>
<div id="chapter-entity" class="chapter-entity">&#8220;Did these people just happen to pass by, or are they here for us? Who are they even?&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao looked at this quickly approaching fleet. There were no organizations&#8217; symbols on their spaceships, so their identity was unknown. Han Xiao was confused.</p>
<p>Seeing that the enemies did not plan to stop, Han Xiao was prepared to fight.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>However, as he was just about to attack, a crack opened at the space wall not far away again—Clotti had arrived.</p>
<p>The next moment, this fleet stopped moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on with this fleet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao looked at this fleet wondering. This time, Clotti flew over, so he turned to him and greeted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency Dark Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, Black Star.&#8221; Clotti nodded slightly. He then turned to look at the barely alive Traveler under Ames&#8217; foot and asked, &#8220;How did you meet him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a coincidence…&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao briefly explained what had happened.</p>
<p>After Clotti heard the story, even his eyes slightly twitched on his usually expressionless face as he softly said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s really unfortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>After he thrashed the Evil Convergence, he had lost track of Traveler. He was just thinking about how he was going to continue chasing after Traveler, but to his surprise, Traveler was so unlucky he met Black Star right after.</p>
<p>He was not curious about why Han Xiao was there. Clotti was not concerned about other Beyond Grade As&#8217; private matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard your mission is to kill him?&#8221; Han Xiao asked.</p>
<p>Clotti nodded. &#8220;Traveler is just one target. The Ruler&#8217;s order is to kill if capturing isn&#8217;t possible. If captured, he will be publicly executed, which will be broadcast live to the entire universe… Oh, and also interrogate who hired him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have other hunting targets too?&#8221;</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>Clotti glanced at him and said, &#8220;Just some neutral Beyond Grade As who like to be mercenaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they related to the attack on Hila?&#8221; Han Xiao was curious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the dynasty says.&#8221; Clotti&#8217;s tone was completely carefree.</p>
<p>Han Xiao was speechless. Those neutral Beyond Grade As who were marked as targets were most probably innocent in this matter, but unluckily for them, they became the dynasty&#8217;s tools to set an example.</p>
<p>Dark Lord was indeed loyal to the dynasty; he showed no care for it at all. The difficult environment these neutral Beyond Grade As lived in could be seen clearly from this matter.</p>
<p>Han Xiao then thought of the Super Star Cluster civilizations and understood. The targets the dynasty had chosen were probably those who were hired by the Super Star Cluster Alliance. Using the attack on Hila as an excuse, the dynasty clearly decided to intimidate the others and cut away the Super Star Cluster Alliance&#8217;s feathers.</p>
<p>At the same time, they might hope to imitate the Tragedy Of The Pinnacles to reduce the number of Beyond Grade As using the incident as an excuse.</p>
<p>Han Xiao shook his head, changed the topic, and said, &#8220;I interrogated him earlier and got the identity of who&#8217;s behind this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>The communication between the two of them was not private; Traveler heard it too. His expression changed instantly as he stared at Han Xiao nervously, afraid he would spit out the Star Arc Civilization.</p>
<p>However, he saw Han Xiao give him a look.</p>
<p>Traveler instantly understood and hastily interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorokin! He hired me to attack Black Star Palace to divert Black Star&#8217;s attention and provide indirect assistance to the federation and the church!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him? Isn&#8217;t he just a pure businessman?&#8221; Clotti frowned and was a little surprised. He glanced at Han Xiao and said, &#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s believable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s quite believable. Traveler is just a neutral mercenary; he wouldn&#8217;t attack me out of nowhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled.</p>
<p>The Star Arc Civilization was indeed related, but Han Xiao had signaled Traveler to hide his identity and blame everything on Sorokin. This way, the dynasty&#8217;s hatred would not be diverted and would all go to Sorokin.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sorokin was actually involved, so there would definitely be proof.</p>
<p>Although the Great Mechanic Han was a soon-to-be shareholder of the Limitless Financial Group, he would not help Sorokin just for the sake of dividends. Furthermore, he only just knew that he was secretly plotting against him.</p>
<p>Hence, he wanted to borrow the Crimson Dynasty&#8217;s power to cause some trouble for Sorokin, at least make the upper echelons be cautious about that guy.</p>
<p>&#8220;… I&#8217;ll tell the Ruler. However, I&#8217;ll still have to take Traveler back for further interrogation,&#8221; Clotti said.</p>
<p>Han Xiao nodded, turned, and patted Ames&#8217; thigh, signaling her to raise her leg. Then, he took out the Spacetime Amber and sealed Traveler up.</p>
<p>While doing this, Han Xiao pointed at the fleet not far away that was trying to stay unnoticed.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;ve been meaning to ask, are they your troops?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Clotti was stunned for a moment. &#8220;I thought they were your men.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noticed that this fleet was the fleet he had just met earlier as soon as he arrived. Seeing that Han Xiao was together with this fleet, he had thought they were on the same side and that he misunderstood earlier, so he did not pay much attention.</p>
<p>However, from Han Xiao&#8217;s perspective, he only gave the coordinates to Dark Lord, and this fleet arrived right before Dark Lord. Hence, he thought this fleet belonged to him.</p>
<p>Both of them had thought this fleet belonged to the other person. Only then did they realize it was a third party.</p>
<p>Having realized that, Clotti opened the public channel and yelled, &#8220;Who are you? Why are you following me‽&#8221;</p>
<p>From the way he looked at it, having met them twice, the only explanation was that they were following him.</p>
<p>At this time, inside the command room of the fleet, Law and Fay were both going mad.</p>
<p>Initially, they had locked onto Black Star and were just about to attack. However, to their absolute surprise, the first peak Beyond Grade A they marked on their radar moved at the last second and arrived in this secondary dimension.</p>
<p>This sudden situation messed up their plan. The two of them hastily told the fleet to stop and did not dare fire.</p>
<p>Seeing that Black Star was on the same side as the other peak Beyond Grade A, the two of them realized how tough the situation was. If they attacked, things would become much more difficult, and there would be a lot of uncertainties.</p>
<p>They only wanted to attack when Han Xiao was alone, so they wanted to make an excuse and retreat to find another opportunity.</p>
<p>Hearing Clotti&#8217;s question, Law had no choice but to use the excuse he gave when they first met.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency Beyond Grade A, we didn&#8217;t expect to meet you again. We only came here to explore because we detected special energy here, but we never thought it would be you again. We&#8217;ll leave now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Law was just about to tell the fleet to turn around and leave, but this time, Clotti stopped them and said with a cold tone, &#8220;Never mind one time, but this is the second time, and you&#8217;re still using the same excuse. Do you think I&#8217;ll believe you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clotti did not believe in coincidences. He had already suspected their identity earlier, but back then, his focus had been on the mission, and he did not want to get involved in meaningless trouble. Now, however, Traveler was already dealt with, so he did not plan to let this mysterious fleet go again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really is a coincidence. We&#8217;re just a civilian exploration team…&#8221; Law had no choice but to continue faking it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;ll be easy. Stop your ships and let us search them. If there really isn&#8217;t a problem, I&#8217;ll let you leave,&#8221; Clotti said with a deep voice.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Law and Fay exchanged looks and communicated with each other telepathically.</p>
<p>&#8220;What should we do now? They won&#8217;t let us go easily. Are we really going to let them into our ships?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it looks like we have no choice…&#8221;</p>
<p>The two of them were both in an extremely bad mood. They completely did not want to attack in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>However, they had already exposed themselves, and there was no way they could let them board their ships.</p>
<p>Law clenched his teeth and slammed the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Clotti proposed to board and investigate, this mysterious fleet suddenly stopped responding.</p>
<p>After waiting for a few seconds, seeing that they were still silent, Clotti said with an even more serious tone, &#8220;This is your last warning. If you do not reply within ten seconds, I will crush you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao was watching Clotti communicate with this mysterious fleet. He thought that they had come for Dark Lord, so he just watched on.</p>
<p>Hearing Clotti&#8217;s warning, Han Xiao thought about it and said, &#8220;No need to attack. I can hack into those spaceships and control them, search through their database, and find out who they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clotti pondered for two seconds, nodded, and said, &#8220;Alright, then I&#8217;ll trouble you too…&#8221;</p>
<p>Before his sentence finished, a sudden change occurred!</p>
<p>The few battleships suddenly fired without any warnings. Cone-shaped solid bullets shot out and headed to the few of them, dragging long paths of flame behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solid bullets?&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the regular weapons at his level had already become dark energy and psionic energy blasters, Han Xiao did not underestimate solid bullets. This was because since they had the ability to travel between secondary dimensions, the gunpowder inside those solid bullets would definitely not be ordinary.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Ames raised her hand and locked all the bullets in midair with her force field.</p>
<p>Seeing that the opponents had attacked, Han Xiao immediately activated Virtual Intrusion and attacked the database of these spaceships without hesitation.</p>
<p>However, the instant Han Xiao&#8217;s data needle penetrated the spaceships&#8217; artificial intelligence, an invisible force flowed into his brain through the quantum network connection.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A powerful shock exploded in his mind, his memory palace suddenly collapsed. Countless sheets of paper representing memories turned into tornados and spun violently.</p>
<p>From Han Xiao&#8217;s perspective, countless memory fragments flashed past his mind, and he could not maintain his usual thoughts.</p>
<p>At the same time, a notification popped up on the interface.</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>You have been hacked by [Memory Formatting Virus—Quantum Network Type].</p>
<p>Your class is detected to be [Virtual Mechanic].</p>
<p>[Memory Formatting Virus—Quantum Network Type] has 200% damage on you.</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>&#8220;This is…&#8221;</p>
<p>Shocked, Han Xiao felt like the world was spinning.</p>
<p>This virus had entered his quantum soul. It was no ordinary debuff. It had messed up his mind on the virtual level, as if an ill-mannered kid had come into his house and flipped around all of his neatly arranged stuff. Han Xiao had no choice but to focus on resisting it.</p>
<p>Seeing his situation, Clotti&#8217;s eyes became serious. Dark energy gathered as he launched an attack.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, the tons of [Dimensional Exile Bullet] that were fixed in midair by Ames exploded, releasing expanding chaotic space streams, and devoured Clotti&#8217;s attack, transferring it to God knew where.</p>
<p>Not only that, but those chaotic space streams were also tearing the space wall of this Land of Dead Silence, creating more holes.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Ames immediately targeted her force field at those spaceships.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, Fay acted from within the main ship. A fog-like protective shield expanded with her in the center and guarded the fleet, blocking Ames&#8217; force field, clashing with Ames&#8217; strength. Ames was unable to instantly destroy the spaceships.</p>
<p>The next moment, a special disc-shaped device extended from the head of the main ship that was prepared since long ago. It looked like some kind of radar to enhance a certain waveform. It suddenly shook and released a ring of shockwave.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>This shockwave passed through Clotti, Han Xiao, and Ames. The three of them suddenly became stiff. The energy they could manipulate any way they wanted usually suddenly started to riot, making controlling their own body much more difficult. It was as if every single cell in their body was fighting against their mind.</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>You have been affected by [High Level Life Form Energy Disorder Shockwave—Beyond Grade A Frequency Type].</p>
<p>Your total level is detected to be Lv.320.</p>
<p>[High Level Life Form Energy Disorder Shockwave—Beyond Grade A Frequency Type] has a 320% effect on you.</p>
<p>_____________________</p>
<p>&#8220;It worked. We don&#8217;t have much time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Law raised his arm, and his sleeves slid down, exposing an arm guard style metal device on his wrist. This was a special device made to capture Primal Esper Ability Entities. He then pointed it at the Mysterious Energy Host.</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>As if it had suddenly gained a ton of energy, Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy suddenly expanded and destroyed the Mysterious Energy Host from within, instantly escaping.</p>
<p>However, before it could move, an invisible force grabbed onto its body, and it flew uncontrollably toward the fleet.</p>
<p>On the other side, the spaceships were also doing something. The second wave of Dimensional Exile Bullets was shot toward the three of them. Clotti barely used his Esper Ability to form a shield around his body.</p>
<p>However, the chaotic space stream devoured Clotti entirely together with his shield, and he disappeared.</p>
<p>At this crucial moment, Han Xiao barely suppressed the virus in his mind, tried his best, and grabbed Ames&#8217; arm. He activated Void Travel and got out of the range of the Dimensional Exile Bullets.</p>
<p>The next moment, he raised his hand and released a restraining force field, grabbing onto Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>Hu!</p>
<p>Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy was like a piece of cloth being pulled from two opposite directions.</p>
<p>Law&#8217;s tone became hasty. &#8220;Black Star is recovering. We can&#8217;t linger any longer, or we&#8217;ll certainly die. Take as much as possible!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, his hand sign changed as he activated another function of the device on his wrist, slashing off a small part of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>Like being absorbed by a black hole, this portion of energy flowed into Law&#8217;s arm guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quickly, go!&#8221;</p>
<p>After this, the fleet shot one Dimensional Exile Bullet that exploded as soon as it left the barrel. The chaotic space stream devoured the fleet, and it disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Only after close to a minute did Ames slowly start to regain control of her body. She took a deep breath and said with a shocked tone, &#8220;What were those attacks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all special technology invented through Primal Esper Ability Entities…&#8221;</p>
<p>Without exterior interference, Han Xiao had already cleared out most of the virus and rearranged his memory palace. He was looking grave.</p>
<p>From the very start, all this fleet used was technology, yet the three of them were forced into an extremely passive state. Han Xiao had a very heavy impression of this special technology, as it had appeared in his previous life.</p>
<p>Be it the Memory Formatting Virus, Dimensional Exile Bullet, or the High Level Life Form Energy Disorder Shockwave, they were all invented through studying different Primal Esper Ability Entities. They had many different uses.</p>
<p>Among them, the Dimensional Exile Bullet had no effects in the main universe, since the space structure of the main universe was completely different from the secondary dimensions. However, in the secondary dimensions, this was powerful technology that could be used in many ways, including splitting up the battlefield, escaping, and damaging secondary dimensions.</p>
<p>The Memory Formatting Virus was a technological product that affected one&#8217;s mind. It came from Primal Esper Ability Entities and was improved to be used through the quantum network. It was specially targeted at Virtual Intrusions and took effect when Han Xiao was taken by surprise.</p>
<p>The High Level Life Form Energy Disorder Shockwave mainly targeted strong individuals. The higher the target&#8217;s Energy Rank, the more effective it would be. It was basically using an enemy&#8217;s own energy against them. However, Beyond Grade As had very high adaptability, so the effect of the High Level Life Form Energy Disorder Shockwave would decrease every time it was used on the same target, as the cells in their bodies had adapted to its effects.</p>
<p>The enemies were focused on studying Primal Esper Ability Entities, so their containment ability was more advanced. Through stimulating Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy, the Mysterious Energy Host was broken, and they were able to snatch part of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy&#8217;s energy.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Supers were, they were still life forms. Since they were life forms, there were ways to deal with them. No one could be considered invincible. Although the technology of the three Universal Civilizations differed, they all had targeted technology for high-level life forms. For example, the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter was one of them. Even the peak Beyond Grade A Milizaus could not take many hits from it. As advanced civilizations developed further, there would only be more technology of that level.</p>
<p>In a direct battle, be it Han Xiao or Dark Lord, they would be able to easily shatter this fleet. However, the enemy were prepared for this while Han Xiao and Dark Lord were not. Through all kinds of targeted attacks and technology, they had taken them by surprise.</p>
<p>Even Clotti fell for it and was exiled into the chaotic space streams. It was unknown when he would return.</p>
<p>However, being able to restrain the movements of the three of them at once was the most they could do. They did not have enough means of attack to hurt the three of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people&#8217;s target isn&#8217;t Clotti. They&#8217;re here for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao contained the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy again. He had a tight frown on his face.</p>
<p>Ames caught what Han Xiao meant in between the lines and asked curiously, &#8220;You know who they are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a group of people who shouldn&#8217;t have appeared in this era…&#8221;</p></div>            </div>

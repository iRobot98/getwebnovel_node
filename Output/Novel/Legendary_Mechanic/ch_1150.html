<h3>Chapter 1150 Anti-Trust Regulations, Main Storyline of Counterfeiting</h3>
<p>In the free competition zone, Emerald Star Cluster, Planet Rosende…</p>
<p>This was a resource rich planet located within the inner ring of the Star Cluster. It was occupied early on by a Star Cluster level civilization named ‘Thunder Horn’. They had transformed it into a temporary base camp for their exploration army, and the planet was heavily guarded and well stocked with materials and troops.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, the leaders of the Thunder Horn Civilization Exploration army were gathered in the conference room of the headquarters.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>“The two stronghold planets in the central region were invaded successively and breached by the different organizations employed by the Super Star Cluster Alliance. What are your thoughts?”</p>
<p>The chief commander pressed his hands on the table, his sharp eyes looking at all the officers present.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A high-ranking commander with a bristly beard slammed the table as he angrily shouted, “Is there still a need for discussion? Immediately gather manpower for a crusade! My troops are guarding one of the strongholds, and they have been almost completely wiped out. We must fight back!”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Another tall and thin officer with a calmer temperament stroked the lightning-shaped blue horns on his head. This action was similar to a human stroking his beard. He slowly said, “I feel we should wait and see for now. The Super Star Cluster Alliance’s actions have a strategic intention behind. Even if we take our stronghold back, we will be attacked once more. Furthermore, the central region is currently in chaos due to the trouble caused by the Super Star Cluster Alliance, and it’s too dangerous to hold onto our land.” Now that the fourth exploration phase had been completed, the four Star Clusters in the free competition zone were divided into regions, with dozens to hundreds of Star Systems for each Star Cluster. According to their locations, they were divided into the outer edge area, inner ring area, central area, and finally the core area for a total of four layers.</p>
<p>At present, the main strategic goal of the Super Star Cluster Alliance was to completely control the core and central areas, having a stable rear base that could allow them to utilize space transmission methods such as stargates to maintain their supply and transportation channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<p>While this would cause them to be completely surrounded, there was no other way for the Super Star Cluster Alliance. Since guerrilla tactics were not suitable for them, they could only resort to sieging tactics. “Then, what are we going to do? Are we going to obediently pass the stronghold to them and let my men die in vain?” The hot tempered bristly beard lashed out. “Chief commander?” The calm officer turned his head. “I believe your thoughts align with mine.”</p>
<p>The Chief commander looked up when he heard this and replied, “I’m also in favor of waiting. The situation now is not clear.” “They’ve already started fighting. What’s not clear about that?” the hot-tempered officer shouted.</p>
<p>The Chief commander patiently explained, “In this storm, we’re not the main characters. The three Universal Civilizations and the Super Star Cluster Alliance are the true protagonists and chess players. While the fourth exploration phase is called the free competition zone, we’re only forces that have come to pan for gold and occupy land, the chess pieces that took the initiative to enter the chessboard. We are far from being able to influence the overall direction, so we must wait for the three Universal Civilizations to respond.”</p>
<p>“So, we have to count on the three Universal Civilizations to take action for our forces in trouble, to start a war against the Super Star Cluster Alliance, huh?”</p>
<p>“Of course not, the three Universal Civilizations will not enter the fray so easily. After all, the principle of the free competition zone has not been torn apart yet. The Super Star Cluster Alliance has employed so many people. Other than strengthening itself, it was also to stick to the rules of the game. Everyone would use their agents to compete, and it will reach a more intense level once the two armies start fighting officially. However, this is not the time yet.”</p>
<p>The calm officer nodded. “That’s right. Chess pieces like us can only wait for the orders of the players. When the three Universal Civilizations show a reaction will be when we choose our sides, then we will no longer be alone and will have a large number of teammates.”</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>The other senior officers also nodded.</p>
<p>While they were unwilling to be pawns, the moment they chose to enter the free competition zone, it was tantamount to them consenting to being in the game. This was the rule formulated by the three Universal Civilizations. Of course, there would also be no shortage of benefits. Only by being a pawn could they obtain the benefits of the Flickering World, and how much they got depended on their ability.</p>
<p>Beep beep beep… At this moment, a virtual screen popped up at the center of the conference table. On it was an announcement issued by the three Universal Civilizations to the entire universe. The title jumped out in everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Supplementary Regulations on Anti-Monopoly within the Flickering World Fourth Exploration Phase.”</p>
<p>It’s here!</p>
<p>The eyes of the Chief commander flashed, and all of them immediately read the report.</p>
<p>The content of this announcement could be roughly summarized into a few points. Firstly, it defined the Eve of the Incident as the beginning of malicious competition and monopolization, and they believed that the Super Star Cluster Alliance was violating the ‘Regulations on Free Exploration’. Secondly, it ordered the Super Star Cluster Alliance to immediately stop the malicious expansion behavior, strongly condemning them on behalf of the civilizations in the universe. Thirdly, if the Super Star Cluster Alliance still did not repent, they would begin sanctions and redistribute the territory occupied by the Super Star Cluster Alliance.</p>
<p>In the appendix of the announcement, there were plans to implement the sanctions and redistribution. The Crimson Dynasty and the other two universal civilizations expressed that they were unwilling to destroy the ‘Free Exploration Regulations’, so they encouraged the organizations and forces in the free competition zone to launch a siege against the Super Star Cluster Alliance. They would then be given special support based on merit.</p>
<div></div>
<p>At the same time, in their distribution plan, they stated that they would not reclaim the planets that the various forces snatched from the Super Star Cluster Alliance. As a reward for helping them against the Super Star Cluster Alliance, they would reclaim their territory as appropriate after the event… In short, they were dangling a carrot to draw forces to attack the Super Star Cluster Alliance and increase the difficulty of the latter to woo agents over to their side.</p>
<p>One could either choose the three Universal Civilizations or the Super Star Cluster Alliance. There was no third option. If one wished to stay neutral, the end result would be to see their territory gradually being eroded away by the Super Star Cluster Alliance. This was also the scheme of the three Universal Civilizations, as they were confident that no one would silently get robbed.</p>
<p>And in the one in ten million possibility that people really chose to give up their territory than to get involved in the storm, the three Universal Civilizations would just send regular troops into the area, and after going through the Super Star Cluster Alliance, they would no longer reallocate the territory back to the other forces, instead occupying it.</p>
<p>As for the third party Beyond Grade A organizations, they were a special existence within this storm. Only they had the capital to remain neutral, and at the same time, the three Universal Civilizations as well as the Super Star Cluster Alliances would avoid their territory to a certain extent.</p>
<p>This was the influence brought about by the establishment of the Development Union, which was different from the trend in his past life. The butterfly effect had already begun to take effect!</p>
<p>Of course, this was based on the premise that the majority of the Beyond Grade As would keep to watching as much as possible. Their forces could also take the opportunity to expand, but taking advantage of this battle had to be controlled to a degree.</p>
<p>“An insidious strategy.” The chief commander coldly snorted before suddenly increasing his volume. “Have the organization leave with the fleet for the central area. The time is right. We now have enough indirect allies.”</p>
<p>Everyone stood up, giving a military salute.</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Black Star Army’s frontline stronghold in the Emerald Star Cluster, the outbreak caused an uproar among the army players. A large number took to the frontlines to explore, causing the dining hall to be filled with a wave of black as all the players in combat uniforms gathered. “What’s happening? I went for a business trip a few days ago and didn’t come online, but how did the world change so drastically? What are these guild alliances doing?” “The Super Star Cluster Alliance wants to unify the free competition zone, but how did the Northern Battlefront and the Galactic Business Alliance come on board?”</p>
<p>“I read the forums, and they seemed to have gotten the main storyline mission from the Super Star Cluster Alliance.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t have a related mission. Does that mean that you have to be in the Super Star Cluster Alliance faction in order to obtain the mission?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<p>“That might not be so. Haven’t some people analyzed the current situation? The three Universal Civilizations will definitely not let this slip. Since we’re in the Black Star Army, we should naturally stand on the side of the three Universal Civilizations.”</p>
<p>Just as everyone was discussing the matter, the announcement of the three Universal Civilizations popped up on the floating screen in the main hall, attracting everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>After reading the report, the atmosphere started to heat up once more.</p>
<p>“Haha, see what I said. Such a huge plot cannot just be a unilateral main storyline.” “So, this is a faction war, with the three Universal Civilizations and the Super Star Clusters on opposite sides?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to fight a national war!” The players were excited. But after a while, their interface still remained silent, leading to everyone feeling confused. “This can’t be. Didn’t they say it was a faction battle? How are we not involved in the main storyline?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that we have to trigger it ourselves? But who do we look for?”</p>
<p>“We’re members of the army, so maybe we have to wait for the army to issue an official announcement for the mission?” Just when everyone was in a state of uncertainty, the Phillip subprogram on everyone’s communicator suddenly popped up, issuing a notice.</p>
<p>Black Star Army Expedition Order.</p>
<p>In view of the contradiction between the three Universal Civilizations and the Super Star Cluster Alliance, the army has decided to carry out an armed crusade against the Modo Civilization Exploration Force. The reasons are detailed in the appendix ‘Kunde Civilization’ (Expand/Collapse). Only the Modo Civilization will be targeted, and there is no need to bother about the other Super Star Cluster Alliance Civilizations. If there are any forces that prevent our actions, you are allowed to retaliate. The primary strategic goal is to expel and kill the Modo Civilization and its affiliated organizations. All troops cannot deviate from this strategy.</p>
<p>As soon as the announcement popped out, a mission notice was seen on the interface of all the players present.</p>
<p>Except for the specific requirement, there was no difference from the main storyline missions obtained by the Super Star Cluster Alliance players.</p>
<p>Seeing this, many of them smiled with joy. “That’s right. We really need the army to issue an announcement before we can activate the main storyline mission.” “So, there’s a grudge between the Modo Civilization and us?”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Sigh, one look and you’re the sort that did not read the background story of the version update. The Modo Civilization conspired to use the Kunde Race in the Flickering World to annihilate everyone. They’re such low people and deserve to be beaten up.”</p>
<p>The countless army players could not wait to immediately enter the central area.</p>
<p>However, what they were unaware of was that the task they triggered was actually problematic and was not the main storyline of the battle between the three Universal Civilizations and the Super Star Cluster Alliance.</p>
<p>The ordinary vassals of the three Universal Civilizations or Super Star Cluster Alliance mercenaries would not specify which civilization to fight; the players would improve their Mission Rating so long as they helped their forces expand. The missions for the army players, while in the same model, was simply to attack the Modo Civilization.</p>
<p>Because of the united front, the Black Star Army and the other Beyond Grade As could not respond to the call of the Crimson Dynasty and did not have the initiative to get involved in the storm. Thus, the army players would not have the main storyline of the fighting between the two factions!</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to my wit…” Han Xiao secretly breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the excited reactions of the players on the forums.</p>
<p>As early as when the development union required all its members to be neutral, Han Xiao had guessed that the Black Star Army would not be able to join the main storyline of the battle between the three Universal Civilizations and the Super Star Cluster Alliance. As the vice president, if he wished to maintain his status and power, he had to be subject to the collective resolution of the united front.</p>
<p>He had guessed the follow-up impact at that time and thus deliberately left the Modo Civilization as a goal so that the three Universal Civilizations and development union would feel that this was a private vendetta. In this manner, he could justifiably imitate a war mission and make the army players mistakenly treat it as the main storyline. While the mission was simpler than the actual main storyline, the players could only accept it. If there was not even a counterfeit main storyline, then the large number of players would be disappointed and might even switch factions to participate in the national war. There was no doubt about it. After this mission release, the negative impact would be minimized. While the specific missions were different, at least they would be able to enter the national war, which was enough for most players.</p>
<p>At the same time, this could show a contrast with the other Beyond Grade A organizations. Most of them would not be able to participate in the main storyline, but the Black Star Army had a fake main storyline. This would attract some players from the other factions to switch over to his side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the players in the national wars during his previous life had a lot of room for free play. While they got to fight side by side, it also meant they just waged their own wars without caring for each other. The main point of him creating the main storyline was to integrate all his players to go against the Modo Civilization, having a greater chance to complete the mission [Kunde Race Leader’s Last Wish)! In this manner, the hidden danger was basically solved. “United front, united front…” Han Xiao muttered helplessly.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Right now, the united front had become a new shackle to him. While it could be maintained at present, as this clause affected the interests of more members, problems would inevitably rise. It was estimated that the three Universal Civilizations also had plans to drag down the unity of the Beyond Grade A group.</p>
<p>To be honest, as far as he was concerned, he felt that the chance of reaching an agreement between both the development union and the three Universal Civilizations was low. There was a strong conflict of interest between the two sides’ demands.</p>
<p>As far as the union was concerned, because of their different needs, the collective resolutions drawn currently were naturally not the best plan. It could only be said that it was a plan that no one strongly opposed. The development union wanted the three Universal Civilizations to unconditionally lift the monopoly of knowledge, before talking about other cooperation. In the eyes of the Beyond Grade As, this was a reasonable request because their current source of Ultimate Knowledge was obtained through meritorious service. They had paid enough for many years and collected all the Ultimate Knowledges, but they were not allowed to pass it on to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only by breaking the monopoly of the three Universal Civilizations could the shackles of their factions be lifted. In this manner, the union itself would be responsible for the spread of knowledge, so current and future Beyond Grade As would no longer need to work for the three Universal Civilizations to obtain Ultimate Knowledge. After all, most people were originally not citizens of the three Universal Civilizations and had no responsibility toward them. In this manner, those who wished to join the three Universal Civilizations would only be looking for a strong backer and not for an ulterior motive. However, Han Xiao knew that the chances of the three Universal Civilizations allowing this was slim.</p>
<p>Unconditional? Even he himself thought that this was bullsh*t!</p>
<p>But as the Vice President, he had an obligation to convey the collective resolutions, and at the same time, he could not represent so many people to make claims, so he could only convey the meaning of the association truthfully. Based on Han Xiao’s own ideas, it was not a bad option to agree to the deal proposed by the three Universal Civilizations, which was to deal with the Super Star Cluster Alliance in exchange for them lifting the monopoly on knowledge. However, many of them disagreed. Firstly, they did not wish to undermine their original intention, and secondly, they did not wish to take the risk to get involved in this turmoil. Everyone had a different viewpoint and position… If the two sides remained in this deadlock, Han Xiao concluded that the final result would be that the Beyond Grade A Association would not be able to bear it and start imparting knowledge privately, which would give the three Universal Civilizations an excuse to attack them. “This is difficult… but it’s nothing to me.” Han Xiao shook his head.</p>
<p>First of all, he had already obtained his Ultimate Knowledges. In fact, he did not care about the problem of the monopoly of knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, he knew where the turning point of this matter would be, so he did not care about the problems exposed at this moment. “Wait till the Calamity of the Supers or the World Tree appears, then I’ll be able to break the existing pattern. Now is not the time… Speaking of which, I’m not sure if the Holy Accord has succeeded yet.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Han Xiao smirked.</p>
<p>Temporarily dropping this thought, he picked up his communicator to give someone a call. In the turmoil caused by the Super Star Cluster Alliance, the Beyond Grade As would mostly not be involved, but there would be a small number of people involved in their own private affairs. One of them would definitely be Sorokin.</p>
<p>Their interests were in line this time, and perhaps they could work together quietly this time to turn the Modo Civilization into pigskins.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Han Xiao already had a bold guess about Sorokin’s identity.</p>
<p>“Now’s a good time to verify it…”</p>

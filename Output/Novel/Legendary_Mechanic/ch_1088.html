				<h1 class="chapter-title">1088 Holy Accord“s Pain</h1>
<div class="chapter-entity">After releasing the two captives, Han Xiao did not leave Planet Black Gate immediately but instead summoned the person in charge of the planet and inspected the railway construction progress. He shared some experience and gave some guidance on the construction.</p>
<p>On the way back, Han Xiao also inspected the operations of the stargate toll booth.</p>
<p>The stargate commute network in the Black Star Army territory extended from the Garu Star Cluster all the way to the free competition zone, quick and convenient. It was currently one of the exceedingly few complete transport routes in the Flickering World. There were a large number of people using it every day.</p><div>
<div id="native-2"></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, any outsiders who wanted to use this route had to pay a fee. Han Xiao fully utilized the Chinese talent buried deep in his soul of &#8216;build a road if you want to be rich&#8217;. He had set up toll booths at every stargate.</p>
<p>With a natural money maker like this, within a year of the Flickering World&#8217;s opening, the army had already earned back the cost of building the stargates. This outrageous profit margin proved a fact—buying land was much more profitable than operating businesses.</p>
<p>After returning to Black Star Palace, the first part of the bail from the federation and the church came. The federation paid the most. All of the three gold blueprints came from them, and this was the first gold blueprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mechanical Deity exclusive weapon, Universal Treasure grade mechanical item, Celestial Punishment Edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside the office, Han Xiao chewed on the lava-flavor condensed nutrition bar while reading through the blueprint data from the Federation of Light.</p>
<p>The blueprints the federation agreed to give him were mostly weapons. This was what Han Xiao selected.</p>
<p>According to the information provided by the Federation of Light, this was an idea from the Saint Tyracles, those admirers of the Mechanical Deity. The federation inherited their knowledge and improved on it, fusing some of their special technology into it, and finally turned this incomplete idea into a blueprint.</p>
<p>On the blueprint was the complete design diagram of this weapon. It had some similarities to the Emperor&#8217;s Cape. Its appearance was a long mechanical sword with complex interiors, equipped with powerful close-range combat technology. It could also turn into a giant cannon mode and release various long-range attacks. As its name suggested, it was built to destroy celestial bodies.</p>
<p>Like the Emperor&#8217;s Cape, the Celestial Punishment Edge was also a mega machine, which the Armed Branch excelled in. Although Han Xiao was not, he would still be able to build it with the needed knowledge.</p>
<p>Why did these Saint Tyracles love to design close range combat weapons so much? Did all the true Mechanics have a hidden Pugilist desire inside them waiting to break free?</p>
<p>Complaining was one thing, but he would still undoubtedly have to build it. Han Xiao told Phillip to add the materials for the Celestial Punishment Edge to the next bulk purchase list.</p>
<p>After handling this matter, Han Xiao checked his inbox.</p>
<p>He had received replies from those neutral Beyond Grade A members of the association who were hired by Super Star Cluster Civilizations that he had messaged not too long ago. Most people were worried they might become the target of Dark Lord; only a few were not concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a demand, there&#8217;ll be a solution.&#8221;</p><div>
<div id="native-3"></div>
</div>
<p>Han Xiao&#8217;s eyes sparkled. He chatted with those Beyond Grade As separately for a while, including &#8216;Leader of Colossuses&#8217; Garoze, whom he had once intimidated into retreating.</p>
<p>These people understood what he meant instantly after he gave a subtle hint, and they clearly expressed that they were willing to support Black Star as much as they could in the development union in the future.</p>
<p>Most of these Beyond Grade As did not become allies of the three Universal Civilizations because they did not want to be controlled. However, this would not happen in the development union. They were just normal members of the association, so they had limited control over it. Therefore, they needed an upper echelon with power who could represent their interests and give them better privileges. This was a win-win deal.</p>
<p>Including Garoze, these Beyond Grade As agreed to bring up this matter in the next plenary meeting, and Han Xiao promised to operate around it to eliminate the threat they were facing.</p>
<p>After bringing those people to his side, Han Xiao contacted the dynasty, planning to first notify them.</p>
<p>He expressed his intention, and after waiting for a while, the secretary connected his communication request to Urranrell.</p>
<p>As the scene around him changed, Han Xiao&#8217;s remote projection appeared in the Dynasty Ruler&#8217;s office. Before him was Urranrell, who was sitting behind her desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency Urranrell.&#8221; Han Xiao nodded respectfully as a greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Star.&#8221; Urranrell greeted back, stared into Han Xiao&#8217;s eyes, and cut to the chase. &#8220;You want me to call Clotti back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The purpose of the development union is to eliminate physical conflict between Beyond Grade As. Clotti is now an Honorable Director, so if he attacks the members, it will go against the association&#8217;s purpose…&#8221;</p>
<p>With an expressionless face, Urranrell said, &#8220;On what grounds are you making this suggestion to me today? As an ally of the dynasty or as the vice president of the development union?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both,&#8221; Han Xiao replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Star, in the past few decades, how have you felt about the way the dynasty has been treating you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Win-win.&#8221; Han Xiao smiled.</p>
<p>Urranrell paused and slowly said, &#8220;I must remind you, the Evolutionary Totem business and the territory in the Flickering World, these are all benefits only our allies can enjoy. The dynasty regards you very highly. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some things could not be said directly. The dynasty did not oppose Black Star becoming the vice president of the development union, but they did not want to see Black Star lean toward it too much. They hoped that between the positions of a dynasty ally and the vice president of the development union, Han Xiao would lean toward the former.</p>
<p>The Mechanic Emperor was an example they could learn from. He had made too many contributions and received too much credit. The federation had no choice but to keep rewarding him and supporting him. This had led to the Mechanic Emperor slowly getting out of control. The dynasty did not want to create another Mechanic Emperor.</p>
<p>As if he did not hear Urranrell&#8217;s words between the lines, Han Xiao continued what he was saying. &#8220;Clotti has captured Traveler and another Beyond Grade A, reigniting others&#8217; fear of him. The mission is actually already complete. If he continues to attack others, it might be too much. Furthermore, when I was in the secondary dimensions, I helped him, or things would have turned out differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm… that makes sense too.&#8221; Urranrell thought about his words.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Han Xiao&#8217;s eyes sparkled, and he said, &#8220;Clotti should have reported the results of Traveler&#8217;s interrogation, so you must know that Sorokin played a part in this too. Does the dynasty plan to put him on the list of targets?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The authenticity of his testimony has yet to be investigated. Sorokin&#8217;s motive is still unknown. It&#8217;s not suitable for Clotti to act.&#8221; Urranrell waved her hand. &#8220;If there&#8217;s enough evidence, the dynasty will deal with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Han Xiao secretly gloated.</p>
<p>Sorokin had always been swinging between the three Universal Civilizations, and now Traveler&#8217;s testimony might cause a huge problem to the position he had maintained for a very long time.</p>
<p>He wondered if the dynasty would use forceful means like when they dealt with Traveler. If that was the case, the true strength Sorokin had been hiding would probably be exposed.</p>
<p>The two of them chatted for a while. Urranrell did not give a direct response, only saying that she would consider the proposal of stopping Dark Lord&#8217;s mission. Han Xiao knew where to draw the line and bade farewell on good terms.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A few days later, in the Beyond Grade A Association&#8217;s headquarters on Planet Finn, remote projections of close to a hundred Beyond Grade As gathered to attend the routine plenary meeting in the round table conference room.</p>
<p>Currently, the development union was uniting resources, so the focus of the discussion was the partnership plans between the various Beyond Grade As.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was heated. Everyone there was a leader in their own field. They could make big decisions on the spot, so the process was quite smooth. Everyone made their own proposals and collaborated with other members who possessed the resources they wanted. Slowly, everyone&#8217;s businesses started to connect, forming an enormous profit network. To normal Beyond Grade As, this was an excellent opportunity to partner up with other large Beyond Grade A organizations and achieve mutually-beneficial agreements. With just a recommendation from others, they would receive huge profits.</p>
<p>After the day-to-day affairs were settled, Manison changed the topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the next meeting, the development union is going to welcome two new members, Tolaen and Hades. Due to some personal reasons, they missed the timing when the association was created. They have now gone through the necessary procedures, and they&#8217;ll be attending the next meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The people could not help but look at Han Xiao, who was sitting in the vice president seat. Everyone knew about the &#8216;personal reasons&#8217;, so the atmosphere in the room was quite funny.</p>
<p>After that, Manison looked around and slowly said, &#8220;If there&#8217;s nothing else, that shall be all for this meet…&#8221;</p>
<p>This time, Garoze raised his hand and said, &#8220;I have a question I&#8217;d like to ask Honorable Director Clotti.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone looked over. Clotti, who had been keeping silent, opened his eyes and glanced at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to confirm one thing. We&#8217;re all members of the association now, and we&#8217;re to obey the rules and regulations. Therefore, Your Excellency Clotti, you can&#8217;t attack any members, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only listen to the dynasty&#8217;s orders,&#8221; Clotti said with an expressionless face, not caring at all.</p>
<p>The atmosphere immediately became tense. The direct members of the three Universal Civilizations, who were originally resting with their eyes closed, looked interested too.</p>
<p>With courage, Garoze said in a deep voice, &#8220;I hope the association will take care of this and ensure our safety. I wouldn&#8217;t want His Excellency Dark Lord to suddenly have a wild idea one day and blame me and attack me for a crime I&#8217;ve never committed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as he said that, many neutral Beyond Grade As expressed that they agreed with him. It was clear this was planned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm…&#8221; Manison narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>The association&#8217;s position was rather strange. Although these three Universal Civilizations&#8217; direct members had joined the association, it was obvious they would not listen to the association, and this proposal had brought this problem to the table.</p>
<p>While the request of these neutral Beyond Grade As was totally logical, it was not a decision the association currently had the power to make. He had no right to tell Clotti to stop.</p>
<p>However, the very purpose of the development union was to resolve conflicts between Beyond Grade As, so it had to live up to that. Manison could not possibly say that he could not do it, or it would shake the foundation of the association and make people worry about the association&#8217;s ability to obey its own rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best…&#8221; Manison planned to first agree and think of a solution later.</p>
<p>However, before he could finish, Han Xiao suddenly interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave this problem to me. I&#8217;ll deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garoze and the others understood and all thanked Han Xiao. &#8220;Then we shall leave it to you, Your Excellency Black Star. We&#8217;ll be waiting for the good news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clotti gave Han Xiao a meaningful look and did not speak.</p>
<p>Han Xiao smiled at Clotti and did not intend to speak either. Both of them knew that the one who could make this decision was not present.</p>
<p>Han Xiao even pretended to comfort Garoze, finishing the show.</p>
<p>This time, Manison figured out what was happening and gave him a meaningful look too.</p>
<p>Manison did not mind Han Xiao building connections and establishing his reputation. To him, Black Star was on his side. As long as he could do the job, there was no problem.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After about a week, Clotti received an order from the Dynasty Ruler to stop the mission. He then led the captives back, leaving the Flickering World.</p>
<p>This message quickly spread to all the members. In their mind, Han Xiao became much more reliable.</p>
<p>By actively taking responsibility for this matter and successfully dealing with it, Black Star proved his ability. Knowing that, the others would naturally come to respect him. This would work just about anywhere.</p>
<p>To Han Xiao, this was just a small matter that did not cost him too much. As his position became higher, his opinion became more and more influential to the dynasty&#8217;s decision-making on some unimportant matters. The Dynasty Ruler gave him face, too. Making a dynasty ally sitting in the vice president seat more powerful in the association was clearly better than having the federation&#8217;s Manison have full control over it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after more than half a month&#8217;s time, Aurora had already fully mastered the Holy Light Particle. Without further ado, Han Xiao instantly announced the existence of the Holy Light Seed to the outside world. He emphasized the importance of the new class system granted by the Holy Light Seed. He stated that all army members would be able to acquire Holy Light Seeds after earning merits.</p>
<p>This new source of power made both the players and the Supers interested, but that was all it was, interest. The ordinary people had the strongest response; it was like a storm to them.</p>
<p>Almost everyone hoped to possess powers beyond ordinary men, and this was the best shortcut to it. As long as they awakened Super Genes, they would instantly be promoted into the Supers society and enjoy its privileges.</p>
<p>However, people were born different. Restricted by predetermined talent, most people were destined to be ordinary their entire lives.</p>
<p>Now, however, there was an opportunity to change their fate right in front of their eyes. Furthermore, it was not beyond their reach. As long as they worked for the Black Star Army and made enough contributions, they would have a certain chance of obtaining extraordinary power!</p>
<p>As soon as this announcement was made, countless ordinary people went haywire. The sensation it caused was even more incredible than all the things the army had done in the past added up. After all, the things the army had done were just that, but this announcement was related to the interests of everyone.</p>
<p>The ordinary people had their own way of living. No matter how amazing the Black Star Army was, there were only very few that were willing to work in an armed force. However, it was all different now. The Black Star Army&#8217;s appeal to ordinary people instantly exceeded ninety-nine percent across all industries.</p>
<p>In just five short days, the number of ordinary people requesting to join the army had already exceeded the current number of members of the Black Star Army!</p>
<p>The number of ordinary people in the universe far exceeded the number of Supers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Within a secret research base of the Holy Accord organization, a researcher placed a cooling container in front of Law and Fay, opened its cap, extended his hand into the white cold fog, and took out a device that looked like a mini radar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellencies, this is the detection device I&#8217;ve invented using the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy&#8217;s characteristics. It&#8217;s used to sense the Holy Light Particle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Law clapped with encouragement. &#8220;Good job. This way, we&#8217;ll be able to find the Holy Light Particle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Holy Light Particle has been hidden for many years,&#8221; Fay said. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably sleeping in a certain secondary dimension and has no master now. This is our chance. Is the range of this device long enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>The researcher replied confidently, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, this device can be used together with the cross-dimensional radar. It&#8217;s definitely long enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221; Fay nodded with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Law hurried them. &#8220;Quickly equip it. We have to acquire the Holy Light Particle as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood, I&#8217;ll…&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he finished, an assistant hastily ran in holding a communicator in his hand and said, &#8220;Y-Your Excellencies, look at the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Law and Fay looked over and were stunned.</p>
<p>The image the communicator was displaying was the announcement Han Xiao had made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh*t…&#8221; Law murmured.</p>
<p>Not just the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy but even the Holy Light Particle got taken by Black Star‽</p>
<p>What kind of luck is that‽</p>
<p>Last time, they could only successfully attack Black Star because Black Star was not prepared and knew nothing about their weapons.</p>
<p>The two of them initially thought they would never cross paths with Black Star ever again, so they did not worry at all. They never expected Black Star to have another Primal Esper Ability they needed.</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged looks and saw the powerlessness in each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Another Beyond Grade A would have been fine, why did it have to be Black Star?</p>
<p>Black Star was alert now. The risk of carrying out the operation again would be at least ten times higher. They would be dreaming to think that doing the same thing as last time would work.</p>
<p>&#8220;So… are we still going for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t drag me down if you want to die,&#8221; Fay said with a scornful tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What should we do then? The Holy Light Particle is in his hands. We&#8217;ll have to find a way to take it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would I know?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two of them were at the edge of collapsing.</p>
<p>What should we do‽</p>
<p>The researcher looked left and right before asking,</p>
<p>&#8220;Erm… this detection device I&#8217;ve invented, should I still install it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell do you think‽&#8221;</p></div>            </div>
